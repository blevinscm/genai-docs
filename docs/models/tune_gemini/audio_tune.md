# Audio Tuning 

This page provides prerequisites and detailed instructions for fine-tuning
Gemini on audio data using supervised learning.

## Use cases

Tuning audio models enhances their performance by tailoring them to specific
needs. This can involve improving speech recognition for different accents,
fine-tuning music genre classification, optimizing sound event detection,
customizing audio generation, adapting to noisy environments, improving audio
quality, and personalizing audio experiences. Here are some common audio tuning use
cases:

- **Enhanced voice assistants**:

 - Voice food ordering: Develop voice-activated systems for seamless food ordering and delivery.
- **Audio content analysis**:

 - Automated transcription: Generate highly accurate transcripts, even in noisy environments.
 - Audio summarization: Summarize key points from podcasts or audiobooks.
 - Music classification: Categorize music based on genre, mood, or other characteristics.
- **Accessibility and assistive technologies**:

 - Real-time captioning: Provide live captions for events or video calls.
 - Voice-controlled applications: Develop applications controlled entirely by voice.
 - Language learning: Create tools that provide personalized feedback on pronunciation.

## Limitations

### `Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite`

| Specification | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum audio length per example | 60 minutes |
| Maximum audio files per example | 1 |
| Maximum audio file size | 100MB |

### `Gemini 2.0 Flash`

| Specification | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum audio length per example | 60 minutes |
| Maximum audio files per example | 1 |
| Maximum audio file size | 100MB |

To learn more about audio sample requirements, see the [Audio understanding (speech only)](../../multimodal/audio-understanding.md) page.

## Dataset format

The `fileUri` for your dataset can be the URI for a file in a Cloud Storage
bucket, or it can be a publicly available HTTP or HTTPS URL.

To see the generic format example, see
[Dataset example for Gemini](../gemini-supervised-tuning-prepare.md).

The following is an example of an audio dataset.

```python
{
 "contents": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "parts": [
 {
 "fileData": {
 "mimeType": "audio/mpeg",
 "fileUri": "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/audio/pixel.mp3"
 }
 },
 {
 "text": "Please summarize the conversation in one sentence."
 }
 ]
 }, 
 {
 "role": "model",
 "parts": [
 {
 "text": "The podcast episode features two product managers for Pixel devices discussing the new features coming to Pixel phones and watches."
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
}

```
