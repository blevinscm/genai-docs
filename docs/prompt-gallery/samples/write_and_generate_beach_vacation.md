Not very nice. There should be a cleanup service or something. 2. Awesome place - Martin I am so happy I found this cool beach. It had the nicest sand and was pretty wide, and I almost felt like I had a private section all to myself. I will bring my friends with me next time, for sure. 3. Just okay! - Hans The beach is fine. The weather was fine. The water was fine. Just okay, really. A big plus was the little cafe nearby for snacks and drinks. 4. I loved it, so coming back - Brian I absolutely adore this beautiful beach. I've been here so many times that I thought I should finally leave a review. A few things that I love the most are how lovely the people who come here are, how attentive the lifeguards are, and not least, the perfect temperature of the ocean. It's safe for anyone with children, and there's always some activity to tag along with. Response A California Beach Dream: Fun in the Sun! **Get ready for some fun in the sun!
