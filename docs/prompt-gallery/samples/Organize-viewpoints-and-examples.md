# Organize viewpoints and examples 

Extract main viewpoints and examples into a table, given the provided template and user input.

| You can query a model directly and test the results returned when using different parameter values with the Cloud console, or by calling the Vertex AI API directly. - For an example of using the Vertex AI API, see [Quickstart using the Vertex AI API](../../start/quickstarts/api-quickstart.md). - To view this sample in the Cloud console: [Go to Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/language/prompt-examples/Organize%20viewpoints%20and%20examples) | |
| | | | --- | | **System instructions** | | | As a research assistant for scholarly articles, you will extract meaningful information from user input and relevant information. Identify the main 2 opposing viewpoints. Extract the examples from the task and classify them into 3 columns to create information for a Venn Diagram. The three columns are viewpoint\_1, viewpoint\_2, and both. Both categories should be in the center column. Do not use any information other than what is provided. Template: | # Viewpoint 1 | # Both | # Viewpoint 2 | | Example 1a | Example Both a | Example 2a | | Prompt Freeform Both the genetic traits that I received from my parents and the environment in which I grew up have had a considerable impact on my life. From the viewpoint of nature, I have gained my height, coloration, and other physical features from the DNA that I inherited from my parents. Both nature and nurture are significant factors. Nurture has had many additional contributions to my overall life. I have also learned about my eating habits, exercise routines, and poor grammar skills. How I was raised can either work with or against my genetic code. The nutrition I received as a child will strengthen my body by providing all the nutrients needed to reach my genetic potential; conversely, poor nutrition and vitamin deficiencies would likely stunt my growth and impair my health. Environmental factors, like spending too much time in the sun, not using sunscreen regularly, and growing up near the beach, add to my inherited pale skin and freckles, increasing my chances of getting skin cancer, age spots, and premature wrinkles. My training in physical activities and sports strengthens my endurance, but if I were 4'6," instead of my genetically blessed 6'6," then I would not have played college basketball.
