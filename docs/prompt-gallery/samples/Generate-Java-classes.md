# Generate Java classes 

Create an interface and class implementation in Java.

| | | | --- | | **System instructions** | | | You are a senior Java developer teaching a junior developer and will need to provide a single paragraph at the end of your response summarizing the generated code. | Prompt Freeform In Java, generate two classes: VenusCard and Card. Card will be an interface with the following methods: - 'int pay(int amount, String name)' - 'int withdraw(int amount)' - 'int deposit(int amount)' VenusCard will be a concrete class that implements the Card interface. It should do the following: - Create a receipt for reach payment. - Includes pay() and withdraw() logic to add a 5% fee to any payments or withdrawals if the balance is below 0. - If a transaction would cause the balance to fall below the overdraft limit, the transaction should be rejected and return -1. Response ```python // Define the Card interface interface Card { int pay(int amount, String name); int withdraw(int amount); int deposit(int amount); } //VenusCard class that implements Card interface import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; class VenusCard implements Card { private int balance; private int overdraftLimit = -500; //Example overdraft limit private List<String> receipts; public VenusCard() { this.balance = 0; this.receipts = new ArrayList<>(); } public int pay(int amount, String name) { if (amount <= 0) { return -1; // Reject invalid payment amounts. } if (balance - amount < overdraftLimit) { return -1; // Reject if transaction goes below overdraft limit. } balance -= amount; double fee = 0; if (balance < 0) { fee = amount * 0.05; balance -= fee; } receipts.add("Payment of " + amount + " to " + name + " made. Fee: " + fee); return amount; } public int withdraw(int amount) { if (amount <= 0) { return -1; //Reject invalid withdrawal amounts } if (balance - amount < overdraftLimit) { return -1; // Reject if transaction goes below overdraft limit } balance -= amount; double fee = 0; if (balance < 0) { fee = amount * 0.05; balance -= fee; } receipts.add("Withdrawal of " + amount + " made. Fee: " + fee); return amount; } public int deposit(int amount) { if (amount <= 0) { return -1; //Reject invalid deposit amounts. } balance += amount; receipts.add("Deposit of " + amount + " made."); return amount; } public int getBalance() { return balance; } public List<String> getReceipts() { return receipts; } public static void main(String[] args){ VenusCard card = new VenusCard(); System.out.println(card.deposit(1000)); System.out.println(card.pay(500, "Store A")); System.out.println(card.getBalance()); System.out.println(card.withdraw(800)); System.out.println(card.getBalance()); System.out.println(card.getReceipts()); } } ``` **Summary:** The code implements a `Card` interface defining basic card functionalities (pay, withdraw, deposit). The `VenusCard` class implements this interface, adding features like receipt generation, a 5% fee on transactions when the balance is below zero, and overdraft limit checks to prevent transactions that would result in a balance below the defined overdraft limit. The `main` method provides a simple example of using the `VenusCard` class. Error handling is included to reject invalid transaction amounts (less than or equal to zero). | | | | | --- | --- | | **Model:** | gemini-1.5-flash-002 | | **Temperature:** | 0.2 | | **Max output tokens:** | 8192 | | **TopK:** | 40.0 | | **TopP:** | 0.95 | |
