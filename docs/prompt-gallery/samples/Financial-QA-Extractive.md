Round answer to two decimal places. Explain the answer and point me to the evidence. Response Okay, let's calculate the P/E ratio for FY2022 based on the provided information. **1. Find the Diluted EPS for FY2022:** The document states that the diluted EPS for FY2022 was $8.33. (See page 12 of the document, under "Net Income") **2. Find the Average Stock Price:** The document provides the average price paid per share for the period of November 1-30, 2022, as $270.40. This information is found in the "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" table on page 26. **3. Calculate the P/E Ratio:** The P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings ratio) is calculated as follows: P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Diluted EPS P/E Ratio = $270.40 / $8.33 P/E Ratio = 32.45 **Therefore, the P/E ratio for FY2022 is 32.45.** **Explanation:** The P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings ratio) is a valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share. A higher P/E ratio generally indicates that investors are willing to pay a higher price for each dollar of earnings. In this case, the P/E ratio of 32.40 for McDonald's in FY2022 suggests that investors are willing to pay $32.45 for every $1 of earnings the company generates. **Evidence:** - **Diluted EPS:** Page 12 of the document, under "Net Income" - **Average Stock Price:** Page 26 of the document, under "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" table. | | | | | --- | --- | | **Model:** | gemini-1.5-flash-002 | | **Temperature:** | 0.2 | | **Max output tokens:** | 8192 | | **TopK:** | 40.0 | | **TopP:** | 0.95 | |
