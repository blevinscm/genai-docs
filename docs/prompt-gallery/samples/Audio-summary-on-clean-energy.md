| You can query a model directly and test the results returned when using different parameter values with the Cloud console, or by calling the Vertex AI API directly. - For an example of using the Vertex AI API, see [Quickstart using the Vertex AI API](../../start/quickstarts/api-quickstart.md). - To view this sample in the Cloud console: [Go to Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/language/prompt-examples/Audio%20summary%20on%20clean%20energy) | |
| Prompt Freeform Please provide a summary of the audio. Response Google is committed to powering its offices and data centers with carbon-free energy sources. While wind and solar power have helped meet a majority of their global electricity demand, these sources are intermittent. To address this, Google invested in enhanced geothermal technology, partnering with Fervo Energy on a project in Northern Nevada. This project involves drilling deep wells, creating fractures in the rock, and pumping cold water underground to harness heat from the surrounding rocks. This heat generates steam, producing carbon-free electricity that feeds into the local grid, powering Google Cloud regions in Las Vegas, Henderson, and Reno. The potential of enhanced geothermal technology extends beyond Google, as studies show it could meet a significant portion of global energy demand. Google's support for this breakthrough technology brings the world closer to carbon-free energy. | | | | | --- | --- | | **Model:** | gemini-1.5-flash-002 | | **Temperature:** | 0.2 | | **Max output tokens:** | 8192 | | **TopK:** | 40.0 | | **TopP:** | 0.95 | |
