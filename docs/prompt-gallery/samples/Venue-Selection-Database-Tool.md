With its intimate setting, capacity well-suited to the band's typical audience size, and a rental fee that aligns with their scale, it provides an ideal environment for showcasing their music. The club's existing PA and basic lighting system will meet the band's needs, eliminating the need for extensive external equipment. The single dressing room is also sufficient for the trio.
