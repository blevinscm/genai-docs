| Prompt Freeform [log\_mining\_writing\_assistance\_presentation\_improvement.pdf](https://storage.mtls.cloud.google.com/cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/writing_critique.pdf) Provide point-by-point feedback for improvement of the content of each slide with specific examples to achieve an exemplary presentation. Response Here's a point-by-point feedback for improvement of the content of each slide, aiming for an exemplary presentation: **Slide 1: Zumvie Helps Engineering Managers Optimize Productivity** - **Improvement:** The headline is good, but it lacks a compelling hook. Consider adding a statistic or a brief, impactful statement to grab attention immediately. For example: "Zumvie: Reclaim 5+ Hours a Week for Engineering Managers." or "Stop Wasting Engineering Manager Time: Introducing Zumvie." The font could also be slightly bolder for better impact. **Slide 2: The Problem - Engineering Manager Time** - **Improvement:** The visual is helpful, but the text is weak. Instead of "Spends 5 hours per week on 1:1's," quantify the impact. For example: "5 hours/week on 1:1s = $X lost in productivity per year." This makes the problem more tangible and impactful. Consider adding a brief, impactful sentence summarizing the overall problem. For example: "Inefficient 1:1s are costing engineering managers valuable time and hindering team performance." **Slide 3: The Problem - Detailed Struggles** - **Improvement:** This slide is cluttered. Consider using a more visually appealing chart or graph to represent the four points. A bar chart showing the "hundreds of hours lost yearly" would be more impactful. The icons are okay, but could be more modern and consistent in style. The sentence "The struggles with the 1:1's:" is unnecessary; integrate this information into the chart/graph. **Slide 4: The Solution - Zumvie** - **Improvement:** This slide is too simple. Instead of just stating the number of demos, highlight a key result or benefit from those demos. For example: "Zumvie: Based on 300 demos, engineering managers report a X% increase in team productivity." Add a brief, compelling description of Zumvie's core value proposition. **Slide 5: The Solution - Team Overview** - **Improvement:** This is a good visual, but needs context. What does this data represent? What's the key takeaway? Add a headline that clearly communicates the benefit, such as "Improved 1:1 Efficiency with Zumvie." Explain the color-coding more clearly (perhaps a legend within the graph itself). **Slide 6: Market** - **Improvement:** The slide is clear, but lacks context. What do TAM, SAM, and SOM stand for? Define them briefly (Total Addressable Market, Serviceable Available Market, Serviceable Obtainable Market). The statement about 100-engineer companies is good, but consider adding a percentage to show market penetration potential. For example: "Represents a $6k/month opportunity per 100-engineer company, representing X% of the market." **Slide 7: Add-on to Jira** - **Improvement:** This slide is simple and effective. However, consider adding a brief sentence explaining the benefit of being a Jira add-on. For example: "Seamless integration with Jira for effortless workflow management." **Slide 8: Add-on to Jira - Benefits** - **Improvement:** This slide is good. Consider making the icons more visually appealing and consistent. The text is clear, but could be slightly more concise. **Slide 9: Business Model** - **Improvement:** The slide is clear, but could benefit from a visual. A simple graphic showing the pricing model would be helpful. Consider adding a sentence about the value proposition of the pricing. For example: "Affordable pricing that delivers significant ROI for engineering managers." **Slide 10: Go-to-Market Strategy** - **Improvement:** This slide is well-structured. Consider using a more visually appealing chart or diagram to represent the current and future strategies. The "BRING ORGS OFF JIRA" is a bit aggressive; soften the wording. For example: "Expand to organizations beyond Jira." **Slide 11: Roadmap & Strategy** - **Improvement:** This slide is excellent. The visual timeline is clear and effective. Consider adding brief descriptions of milestones beyond the MRR targets. **Slide 12: What We're Looking For** - **Improvement:** This slide is good, but the text is a bit dense. Break down the team scaling into bullet points for better readability. The calculation of ARR is helpful, but could be simplified. For example: "Targeting $100M ARR based on market penetration." Consider adding a compelling call to action. By implementing these suggestions, the presentation will be significantly more engaging, persuasive, and impactful. Remember to maintain a consistent visual style and brand identity throughout the presentation. | | | | | --- | --- | | **Model:** | gemini-1.5-flash-002 | | **Temperature:** | 0.2 | | **Max output tokens:** | 8192 | | **TopK:** | 40.0 | | **TopP:** | 0.95 | |
