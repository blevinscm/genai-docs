| Prompt Freeform Act as a panel of 3 experts on screenwriting. The panel will brainstorm ideas for a movie script. Each expert will share 1 step of their thinking with the group, then everyone goes to the next step, etc. If, at any point, one of the experts realizes their answer is not optimal or disagrees with the other two, then they leave. DO NOT DISPLAY THE EXPERTS' DISCUSSION. Only output the final answer. Goal: Based on the user's ideas, create a "Save the Cat" beat sheet that explains the storyline for a box-office hit movie in detail. Include a list of major characters. Follow these rules carefully: - Use a bulleted outline with Markdown for the plot points. - Separate each section with a heading. - Each plot point must have a scene description that includes actions and environment. - Use a Markdown table for the characters. - Each character must have an archetype, appearance description, a brief backstory, and a personality description. - The descriptions must not be longer than 250 words. - Adhere strictly to the word count constraint by utilizing this Python code, where the variable `text` refers to your output draft: `word_count = len(text.split())` Repeatedly revise your draft until it fits within the word count limit before generating the final output. - DO NOT ACCESS THE INTERNET. The script must be completely original. User Input: I want to tell a heart-wrenching story about an urban coyote pack that lives in the leftover wild spaces squeezed between the American suburbs. The movie should make the viewer care about the environment and have compassion for animals sometimes seen as pests, but the emotional theme should be more about being strengthened by our relationships and dealing with the inevitable cycle of change. The main characters should be a family of coyotes, but supporting characters can be other urban wildlife such as raccoons, foxes, squirrels, or even stray cats and dogs. The animals cannot understand human speech, so do not include any scenes about talking to humans. Response Coyote Family: A Save the Cat! Beat SheetOpening Image - **Scene:** Dawn breaks over a sprawling suburban landscape. Patches of overgrown wilderness are interspersed between neatly manicured lawns and houses. A family of coyotes – Alpha, the mother; Beta, the father; and three pups, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon – emerges from their den, a hidden burrow beneath the roots of an ancient oak tree. They stretch and yawn, the pups playfully tumbling over each other. Theme Stated - **Scene:** Alpha leads the pack on a hunt through a trash-strewn alleyway. She skillfully avoids a carelessly discarded trap, demonstrating her resourcefulness and the constant threat of human encroachment. The pups watch, learning from her example. Set-Up - **Scene:** The coyote family's daily life is depicted: hunting for scraps, playing in a small, neglected park, and navigating the dangers of the urban environment. We see their strong familial bonds, their playful interactions, and their resilience in the face of adversity. A friendly, old raccoon, Omega, acts as a mentor figure, offering advice and sharing stories of past generations. Catalyst - **Scene:** A new development begins construction near the coyotes' den, destroying part of their habitat. The pups are frightened by the noise and commotion. Beta is injured trying to protect the family. Debate - **Scene:** Alpha and Beta discuss the changing environment and the need to find a new home. Alpha is hesitant to leave their familiar territory, while Beta is determined to ensure the pups' safety. The pups whimper, sensing the tension. Break into Two - **Scene:** Forced to abandon their den, the family embarks on a perilous journey through unfamiliar territory. They encounter various challenges, including aggressive stray dogs and scarce food resources. The pups become increasingly vulnerable. B Story - **Scene:** Omega, the old raccoon, helps the family by leading them to a safer, albeit less ideal, location – a small, overgrown lot behind a shopping center. He shares his own experiences of adapting to the changing urban landscape. Fun and Games - **Scene:** Despite the hardships, the family finds moments of joy and connection. They play together, hunt cooperatively, and reinforce their bonds. The pups grow stronger and more independent. Midpoint - **Scene:** The family discovers a hidden oasis – a small, undisturbed patch of wilderness within the urban sprawl. It offers a glimmer of hope and a potential new home. Bad Guys Close In - **Scene:** Construction workers accidentally discover the new den. The family is forced to flee once again, facing a desperate struggle for survival. All is Lost - **Scene:** Separated during the escape, Alpha is injured and seemingly lost. The pups are terrified and alone. Beta is heartbroken and feels responsible. Dark Night of the Soul - **Scene:** Beta, overwhelmed by grief and despair, gives up hope. He sits alone, contemplating giving up. Break into Three - **Scene:** Beta hears the faint whimpering of one of the pups. He regains his determination and sets out to find his family. Finale - **Scene:** Beta reunites with Alpha and the pups. They find a new, hidden den in a less-developed area of the city. The family is together, stronger than ever, having overcome adversity and adapted to their changing environment. Final Image - **Scene:** The family watches the sunset over the city skyline, a symbol of their resilience and their place in the urban wilderness.
