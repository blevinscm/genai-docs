# Getting help 

## Get a Google support package

Google Cloud offers different support packages to meet different needs, such as
24/7 coverage, phone support, and access to a technical support manager. For
more information, see [Google Cloud Support](Vertex-AI-RAG-Engine-supported-models.md).

## Get support from the community

Ask a question about Vertex AI on [Google Cloud Community](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/cloud-ai-ml/label-name/vertex%20ai%20platform/).
Use the tag `Vertex AI Platform` for questions about Vertex AI. This tag not only receives responses
from the Google Cloud support team, but also from Google engineers, who monitor the tag and offer unofficial support.
