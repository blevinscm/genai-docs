# Break down complex tasks into simpler prompts 

For complex tasks that require multiple instructions or steps, you can improve the model's
responses by breaking your prompts into subtasks. Smaller prompts can help you improve
controllability, debugging, and accuracy.

There are two ways to break down complex prompts and ingest them into a model:

- **Chain prompts:** split a task into subtasks and run the subtaks
 sequentially.
- **Aggregate responses:** split a task into subtasks and run the subtasks in
 parallel.

## Chain prompts

For complex tasks that involve multiple *sequential* steps, make each step a prompt and
chain the prompts together in a sequence. In this sequential chain of prompts, the output of one
prompt in the sequence becomes the input of the next prompt. The output of the last prompt in the
sequence is the final output.

### Example

For example, suppose you run a telecommunications business and want to use a model to help you
analyze customer feedback to identify common customer issues, classify issues into categories, and
generate solutions for categories of issues.

#### Task 1: identify customer issues

The first task you want the model to complete is extracting meaningful data from raw customer
feedback. A prompt that achieves this task might be similar to the following, where
`CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK` is a file that contains the customer feedback:

| Extract data |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Extract the main issues and sentiments from the customer feedback on our telecom services. Focus on comments related to service disruptions, billing issues, and customer support interactions. Please format the output into a list with each issue/sentiment in a sentence, separated by semicolon. Input: CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK ``` |

We would expect the model's response to contain a list of extracted issues and sentiment from the
customer feedback.

#### Task 2: classify issues into categories

Next, you want to prompt the model to classify the data into categories so that you can
understand the types of issues customers face, using the response from the previous task. A prompt
that achieves this task might look similar to the following, where
`TASK_1_RESPONSE` is the response from the previous task:

| Classify data |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Classify the extracted issues into categories such as service reliability, pricing concerns, customer support quality, and others. Please organize the output into JSON format with each issue as the key, and category as the value. Input: TASK_1_RESPONSE ``` |

We would expect the model's response to contain categorized issues.

#### Task 3: generate solutions

Now, you want to prompt the model to generate actionable recommendations based on the
categorized issues to improve customer satisfaction, using the response from the previous task. A
prompt that achieves this might look similar to the following, where
`TASK_2_RESPONSE` is the response from the previous task:

| Generate suggestions |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Generate detailed recommendations for each category of issues identified from the feedback. Suggest specific actions to address service reliability, improving customer support, and adjusting pricing models, if necessary. Please organize the output into a JSON format with each category as the key, and recommendation as the value. Input: TASK_2_RESPONSE ``` |

We would expect the model's response to contain recommendations for each category, aimed at
improving customer experience and service quality, which satifies our overall objective.

## Aggregate responses

In cases where you have complex tasks but you don't need to perform the tasks in a specific
order, you can run parallel prompts and aggregate the model's responses.

### Example

For example, suppose you own a record store and want to use a model to help you decide which
records to stock based on music streaming trends and your store's sales data.

#### Task 1: analyze data

The first thing you need to do is analyze the two datasets, streaming data and sales data. You
can run the prompts to complete these tasks in parallel. Prompts that achieve these tasks might be
similar to the following, where `STORE_SALES_DATA` is a file that contains
the sales data and `STREAMING_DATA` is a file that contains the streaming
data:

| Task 1a: analyze sales data |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Analyze the sales data to identify the number of sales of each record. Please organize the output into a JSON format with each record as the key, and sales as the value. Input: STORE_SALES_DATA ``` |

We would expect the output to contain the number of sales for each record, formatted in JSON.

| Task 1b: analyze streaming data |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Analyze the streaming data to provide a the number of streams for each album. Please organize the output into a JSON format with each album as the key, and streams as the value. Input: STREAMING_DATA ``` |

We would expect the output to contain the number of streams for each album, formatted in JSON.

#### Task 2: aggregate data

Now you can aggregate the data from both datasets to help you plan your purchasing decisions. To
aggregate the data, include the output from both tasks as the input. A prompt that achieves this
might look similar to the following, where `TASK_1A_RESPONSE` and
`TASK_1B_RESPONSE` are the responses from the previous tasks:

| Aggregate sales and streaming data |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Recommend a stocklist of about 20 records based on the most sold and most streamed records. Roughly three quarters of the stock list should be based on record sales, and the rest on streaming. Input: TASK_1A_RESPONSE and TASK_1B_RESPONSE ``` |

We would expect the output to contain a suggested stocklist of about 20 records, based on record
sales and streams, with more favor given to records with proven sales history than to those with
more streaming popularity.
