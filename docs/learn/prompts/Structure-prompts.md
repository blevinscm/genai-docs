# Structure prompts 

How you structure a prompt can affect the model's ability to parse the information in the prompt.
It also helps the model correctly interpret how to use the given information. To give structure to a
prompt, you can use prefixes or XML tags to delimit different parts or components of a prompt.

## Use prefixes to structure simple prompts

A prefix is a word or phrase followed by a colon to label the information in a prompt. In the
following example, "TASK:, "CLASSES:," and "OBJECTS:" are the prefixes.

| |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python TASK: Classify the OBJECTS. CLASSES: - Large - Small OBJECTS: - Rhino - Mouse - Snail - Elephant ``` **Response:** ```python - Rhino: Large - Mouse: Small - Snail: Small - Elephant: Large ``` (gemini-pro) |

## Use XML and other delimiters to structure complex prompts

For complex prompts, use XML and other delimiters to separate components of a prompt. You can use
`BEGIN` and `END` or `{}` section delimiters for complex and
lengthy prompt components to clearly distinguish them from the actual instructions.
