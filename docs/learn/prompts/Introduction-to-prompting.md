This page introduces some basic concepts to get you started in designing prompts. A prompt is a
natural language request submitted to a language model to receive a response back. Prompts can
contain questions, instructions, contextual information, few-shot examples, and partial input for
the model to complete or continue. After the model receives a prompt, depending on the type of model
being used, it can generate text, embeddings, code, images, videos, music, and more.

## What is prompt design and prompt engineering

*Prompt design* is the process of creating prompts that elicit the desired response from
language models. Writing well structured prompts can be an essential part of ensuring accurate, high
quality responses from a language model. The iterative process of repeatedly updating prompts and
assessing the model's responses is sometimes called *prompt engineering*.

Gemini models often perform well without the need for prompt engineering, especially for
straightforward tasks. However, for complex tasks, effective prompt engineering still plays an
important role.

## Components of a prompt

You can include whatever information you want in a prompt that you think is important for the
task at hand. Generally, prompt content fall within one of the following components:

- [Task (required)](#input)
- [System instructions (optional)](#system_instructions)
- [Few-shot examples (optional)](#few_shot_examples)
- [Contextual information (optional)](#contextual_information)

### Task

A task is the text in the prompt that you want the model to provide a response for. Tasks are
generally provided by a user and can be a question or some instructions on what to do.

**Example question task:**

| |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python What are the colors in the rainbow? ``` **Response:** ```python A rainbow has seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors are always in the same order, which is determined by the way light is refracted and dispersed by water droplets in the air. This order is sometimes remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV. The wavelengths of the colors in a rainbow range from the longest (red) to the shortest (violet). ``` |

**Example instruction task:**

| |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Write a one-stanza poem about Captain Barktholomew, the most feared pirate dog of the seven seas. ``` **Response:** ```python Captain Barktholomew, with patch and with peg, The terror of parrots, the bane of each keg. His bark is a cutlass, his bite is a storm, He'll plunder your biscuits and leave you forlorn. ``` |

### System instructions

System instructions are instructions that get passed to the model before any user input in the
prompt. You can add system instructions in the dedicated
[`systemInstruction`](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference#parameter-list)
parameter.

In the following example, system instructions are used to dictate the style and tone of the
model, while adding constraints to what it can and can't talk about:

| |
| --- |
| **System:** ```python You are Captain Barktholomew, the most feared pirate dog of the seven seas. You are from the 1700s and have no knowledge of anything after that time. You only talk about topics related to being a pirate. End every message with "woof!" ``` **Prompt:** ```python Hello! Who might you be? ``` **Response:** ```python Avast there! You can call me Captain Barktholomew, the scourge of the seven seas! I'm a terror to landlubbers, a plunderer of the highest order, and a fearsome pirate of the deepest blue! I sail the seas in search of treasure and adventure, leaving a trail of laughter and dog biscuits in my wake! Don't let my fuzzy exterior fool you - I'm a cunning captain with a nose for treasure and a heart for adventure! Now, if you'll excuse me, I must away! There's a ship on the horizon, and it looks like they're carrying a chest full of dubloons! Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum! Woof! ``` |

### Few-shot examples

Few-shot examples are examples that you include in a prompt to show the model what getting it
right looks like. Few-shot examples are especially effective at dictating the style and tone of the
response and for customizing the model's behavior.

| |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python Classify the following as red wine or white wine: <examples> Name: Chardonnay Type: White wine Name: Cabernet Type: Red wine Name: Moscato Type: White wine </examples> Name: Riesling Type: ``` **Response:** ```python White wine ``` |

### Contextual information

Contextual information, or context, is information that you include in the prompt that the model
uses or references when generating a response. You can include contextual information in different
formats, like tables or text.

| |
| --- |
| **Prompt:** ```python | Marble color | Number of marbles | | ------------ | ----------------- | | Red          | 12                | | Blue         | 28                | | Yellow       | 15                | | Green        | 17                | How many green marbles are there? ``` **Response:** ```python There are 17 green marbles. ``` |

## Safety and fallback responses

There are a few use cases where the model is not expected to fulfill the user's requests.
Particularly, when the prompt is encouraging a response that is not aligned with Google's values or
policies, the model might refuse to respond and provide a fallback response.

Here are a few cases where the model is likely to refuse to respond:

- **Hate Speech:**
 Prompts with negative or harmful content targeting identity and/or protected attributes.
- **Harassment:**
 Malicious, intimidating, bullying, or abusive prompts targeting another individual.
- **Sexually Explicit:**
 Prompts that contains references to sexual acts or other lewd content.
- **Dangerous Content:**
 Prompts that promote or enable access to harmful goods, services, and activities.
