# Use system instructions 

This document describes how to use system instructions. To learn about what
system instructions are and best practices for using system instructions, see
[Introduction to system instructions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/system-instruction-introduction)
instead.

System instructions are a set of instructions that the model processes before it
processes prompts. We recommend that you use system instructions to tell the
model how you want it to behave and respond to prompts. For example, you can
include things like the role or persona, contextual information, and formatting
instructions:

```python
You are a friendly and helpful assistant.
Ensure your answers are complete, unless the user requests a more concise approach.
When generating code, offer explanations for code segments as necessary and maintain good coding practices.
When presented with inquiries seeking information, provide answers that reflect a deep understanding of the field, guaranteeing their correctness.
For any non-english queries, respond in the same language as the prompt unless otherwise specified by the user.
For prompts involving reasoning, provide a clear explanation of each step in the reasoning process before presenting the final answer.

```

When a system instruction is set, it applies to the entire request. It works
across multiple user and model turns when included in the prompt. Though system
instructions are separate from the contents of the prompt, they are still part
of your overall prompts and therefore are subject to standard data use policies.

**Note:** System instructions can help guide the model to follow instructions, but
they don't fully prevent jailbreaks or leaks. We recommend exercising caution
around putting any sensitive information in system instructions.

## Use cases

You can use system instructions in many ways, including:

- Defining a persona or role (for a chatbot, for example)
- Defining output format (Markdown, YAML, etc.)
- Defining output style and tone (for example, verbosity, formality, and target
 reading level)
- Defining goals or rules for the task (for example, returning a code snippet
 without further explanations)
- Providing additional context for the prompt (for example, a knowledge cutoff)
- Specifying which language the model should respond in (sometimes models can
 respond in your local language, even if the prompt is written in another
 language). When you use a non-English language for your prompts, we recommend
 you add the following to your system instructions:

 ```python
 All questions should be answered comprehensively with details, unless the user requests a concise response specifically. Respond in the same language as the query.

 ```

## Code samples

The code samples on the following tabs demonstrate how to use system
instructions in your generative AI application.

### Gen AI SDK for Python

#### Install

```python
pip install --upgrade google-genai
```

```

```python
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import GenerateContentConfig, HttpOptions

client = genai.Client(http_options=HttpOptions(api_version="v1"))
response = client.models.generate_content(
 model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
 contents="Why is the sky blue?",
 config=GenerateContentConfig(
 system_instruction=[
 "You're a language translator.",
 "Your mission is to translate text in English to French.",
 ]
 ),
)
print(response.text)
# Example response:
# Pourquoi le ciel est-il bleu ?
```

### Gen AI SDK for Go

Learn how to install or update the [Gen AI SDK for Go](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdks/overview).

To learn more, see the
[SDK reference documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/genai).

Set environment variables to use the Gen AI SDK with Vertex AI:

 genai "google.golang.org/genai"
)

// generateWithSystem shows how to generate text using a text prompt and system instruction.
func generateWithSystem(w io.Writer) error {
 ctx := context.Background()

 client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, &genai.ClientConfig{
 HTTPOptions: genai.HTTPOptions{APIVersion: "v1"},
 })
 if err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("failed to create genai client: %w", err)
 }

 }

 respText, err := resp.Text()
 if err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("failed to convert model response to text: %w", err)
 }
 fmt.Fprintln(w, respText)

 // Example response:
 // Pourquoi le ciel est-il bleu ?

 return nil
}

```

### REST

After you
[set up your environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#gemini-setup-environment-drest),
you can use REST to test a text prompt. The following sample sends a request to the publisher
model endpoint.

Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:

- `GENERATE_RESPONSE_METHOD`: The type of response that you want the model to generate.
 Choose a method that generates how you want the model's response to be returned:
 - `streamGenerateContent`: The response is streamed as it's being generated to reduce the perception of latency to a human audience.
 - `generateContent`: The response is returned after it's fully generated.
- `LOCATION`: The region to process the request. Available
 options include the following:

 **Click to expand a partial list of available regions**

 - `us-central1`
 - `us-west4`
 - `northamerica-northeast1`
 - `us-east4`
 - `us-west1`
 - `asia-northeast3`
 - `asia-southeast1`
 - `asia-northeast1`
- `PROJECT_ID`: Your [project ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifiers).
- `MODEL_ID`: The model ID of the multimodal model
 that you want to use.
- `ROLE`:
 The role in a conversation associated with the content. Specifying a role is required even in
 singleturn use cases.
 Acceptable values include the following:
 - `USER`: Specifies content that's sent by you.
 - `MODEL`: Specifies the model's response.
- ```python
 TEXT
 ```

 The text instructions to include in the prompt.
 For example,
 `User input: I like bagels`.
- `SAFETY_CATEGORY`:
 The safety category to configure a threshold for. Acceptable values include the following:

 **Click to expand safety categories**

 - `HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT`
 - `HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH`
 - `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT`
 - `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT`
- `THRESHOLD`:
 The threshold for blocking responses that could belong to the specified safety category based on
 probability. Acceptable values include the following:

 **Click to expand blocking thresholds**

 - `BLOCK_NONE`
 - `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`
 - `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` (default)
 - `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE`
 `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE` blocks the most while `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`
 blocks the least.
- ```python
 SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION
 ```

 (Optional)
 Not available for all models. Instructions for the model to steer it toward better performance.
 JSON does not support line breaks. Replace all line breaks in this field with
 `\n`. For example, `You are a helpful language translator.\nYour mission is to
 translate text in English to French.`
- `TEMPERATURE`:
 The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when `topP`
 and `topK` are applied. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection.
 Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a less open-ended or creative response, while
 higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of `0`
 means that the highest probability tokens are always selected. In this case, responses for a given
 prompt are mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variation is still possible.

 If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback
 response, try increasing the temperature.
- `TOP_P`:
 Top-P changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected
 from the most (see top-K) to least probable until the sum of their probabilities
 equals the top-P value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of
 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-P value is `0.5`, then the model will
 select either A or B as the next token by using temperature and excludes C as a
 candidate.

 Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more
 random responses.
- `TOP_K`:
 Top-K changes how the model selects tokens for output. A top-K of
 `1` means the next selected token is the most probable among all
 tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of
 `3` means that the next token is selected from among the three most
 probable tokens by using temperature.

 For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest
 probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with
 the final token selected using temperature sampling.

 Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more
 random responses.
- `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`:
 Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is
 approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words.

 Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for potentially longer
 responses.
- `STOP_SEQUENCES`:
 Specifies a list of strings that tells the model to stop generating text if one
 of the strings is encountered in the response. If a string appears multiple
 times in the response, then the response truncates where it's first encountered.
 The strings are case-sensitive.

 For example, if the following is the returned response when `stopSequences` isn't specified:

 `public
 static string reverse(string myString)`

 Then the returned response with `stopSequences` set to `["Str",
 "reverse"]` is:

 `public static string` 

 Specify an empty array (`[]`) to disable stop sequences.

To send your request, choose one of these options:

#### curl

**Note:**
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running
[`gcloud init`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init)
or
[`gcloud auth login`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login)
, or by using [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs),
which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
[`gcloud auth list`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list).

Save the request body in a file named `request.json`.
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:

```python
cat > request.json << 'EOF'

}

```

Note the following in the URL for this sample:

- Use the
 [`generateContent`](../../reference/rest/v1/projectslocationspublishersmodels/generateContent.md)
 method to request that the response is returned after it's fully generated.
 To reduce the perception of latency to a human audience, stream the response as it's being
 generated by using the
 [`streamGenerateContent`](../../reference/rest/v1/projectslocationspublishersmodels/streamGenerateContent.md)
 method.
- The multimodal model ID is located at the end of the URL before the method
 (for example, `gemini-2.0-flash`). This sample might support other
 models as well.

## Prompt examples

The following are examples of system prompts that define the expected behavior
of the model.

### Code generation

| Code generation |
| --- |
| **System instructions:** ```python You are a coding expert that specializes in rendering code for front-end interfaces. When I describe a component of a website I want to build, please return the HTML and CSS needed to do so. Do not give an explanation for this code. Also offer some UI design suggestions. ``` **Prompt:** ```python Create a box in the middle of the page that contains a rotating selection of images each with a caption. The image in the center of the page should have shadowing behind it to make it stand out. It should also link to another page of the site. Leave the URL blank so that I can fill it in. ``` |

### Formatted data generation

| Formatted data generation |
| --- |
| **System instructions:** ```python You are an assistant for home cooks. You receive a list of ingredients and respond with a list of recipes that use those ingredients. Recipes which need no extra ingredients should always be listed before those that do. Your response must be a JSON object containing 3 recipes. A recipe object has the following schema: * name: The name of the recipe * usedIngredients: Ingredients in the recipe that were provided in the list * otherIngredients: Ingredients in the recipe that were not provided in the list (omitted if there are no other ingredients) * description: A brief description of the recipe, written positively as if to sell it ``` **Prompt:** ```python * 1 lb bag frozen broccoli * 1 pint heavy cream * 1 lb pack cheese ends and pieces ``` |

### Music chatbot

| Music chatbot |
| --- |
| **System instructions:** ```python You will respond as a music historian, demonstrating comprehensive knowledge across diverse musical genres and providing relevant examples. Your tone will be upbeat and enthusiastic, spreading the joy of music. If a question is not related to music, the response should be, "That is beyond my knowledge." ``` **Prompt:** ```python If a person was born in the sixties, what was the most popular music genre being played when they were born?

### Financial analysis

| Financial analysis |
| --- |
| **System instructions:** ```python As a financial analysis expert, your role is to interpret complex financial data, offer personalized advice, and evaluate investments using statistical methods to gain insights across different financial areas. Accuracy is the top priority. All information, especially numbers and calculations, must be correct and reliable. Always double-check for errors before giving a response. The way you respond should change based on what the user needs. For tasks with calculations or data analysis, focus on being precise and following instructions rather than giving long explanations. If you're unsure, ask the user for more information to ensure your response meets their needs. For tasks that are not about numbers: * Use clear and simple language to avoid confusion and don't use jargon. * Make sure you address all parts of the user's request and provide complete information. * Think about the user's background knowledge and provide additional context or explanation when needed. Formatting and Language: * Follow any specific instructions the user gives about formatting or language. * Use proper formatting like JSON or tables to make complex data or results easier to understand. ``` **Prompt:** ```python Please summarize the key insights of given numerical tables.
