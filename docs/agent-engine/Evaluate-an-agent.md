title: Evaluate An Agent
---

```

**Note:** Example datasets are for demonstration purposes and shouldn't be used in production.

### Example datasets

We have provided the following example datasets to demonstrate how you can
evaluate agents:

- `"on-device"`: Evaluation dataset for an On-Device Home Assistant. The agent
 helps with queries such as "Schedule the air conditioning in the bedroom so
 that it is on between 11pm and 8am, and off the rest of the time."
- `"customer-support"`: Evaluation dataset for a Customer Support Agent. The
 agent helps with queries such as "Can you cancel any pending orders and
 escalate any open support tickets?"
- `"content-creation"`: Evaluation dataset for a Marketing Content Creation
 Agent. The agent helps with queries such as "Reschedule campaign X to be a
 one-time campaign on social media site Y with a 50% reduced budget, only on
 December 25, 2024."

To import the example datasets:

1. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the
 `gcloud` CLI.
2. Download the evaluation dataset.

 ### On Device

 ```python
 gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-ai-demo-datasets/agent-eval-datasets/on-device/eval_dataset.json .
 ```

 ### Customer Support

 ```python
 gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-ai-demo-datasets/agent-eval-datasets/customer-support/eval_dataset.json .
 ```

 ### Content Creation

 ```python
 gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-ai-demo-datasets/agent-eval-datasets/content-creation/eval_dataset.json .
 ```
3. Load the dataset examples

 ```python
 import json

 eval_dataset = json.loads(open('eval_dataset.json').read())

 ```

## Generate evaluation results

To generate evaluation results, run the following code:

```python
from vertexai.preview.evaluation import EvalTask

eval_task = EvalTask(dataset=eval_dataset, metrics=metrics)
eval_result = eval_task.evaluate(runnable=agent)

```

## View and interpret results

The evaluation results are displayed as follows:

The evaluation results contain the following information:

### Final response metrics

**Row-wise metrics**:

- `response`: Final response generated by the agent.
- `latency_in_seconds`: Time taken (in seconds) to generate the response.
- `failure`: Indicates whether a valid response was generated or not.
- `score`: A score calculated for the response specified in the metric spec.
- `explanation`: The explanation for the score specified in the metric spec.

**Summary metrics**:

- `mean`: Average score for all instances.
- `standard deviation`: Standard deviation for all the scores.

### Trajectory metrics

**Row-wise metrics**:

- `predicted_trajectory`: Sequence of tool calls followed by agent to reach the final response.
- `reference_trajectory`: Sequence of expected tool calls.
- `score`: A score calculated for the predicted trajectory and reference trajectory specified in the metric spec.
- `latency_in_seconds`: Time taken (in seconds) to generate the response.
- `failure`: Indicates whether a valid response was generated or not.

**Summary metrics**:

- `mean`: Average score for all instances.
- `standard deviation`: Standard deviation for all the scores.
