# Agent Framework Kit

## Introduction

The Agent Framework Kit (AFK) provides a flexible and powerful environment for building, managing, and deploying autonomous agents. These agents can perform a wide variety of tasks, from simple automation to complex decision-making processes. AFK is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create custom agents tailored to their specific needs. This document provides an overview of how to construct a generic agent within the AFK and demonstrates a practical example of an agent that evaluates code.

## Core Concepts

Before diving into agent construction, let's understand a few core concepts:

*   **Agent**: An autonomous entity that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.
*   **Skill**: A reusable component that defines a specific capability or action an agent can perform. For example, reading a file, calling an API, or executing code.
*   **Tool**: An external resource or utility that an agent can leverage, often accessed via a Skill. Examples include code linters, APIs, or databases.
*   **Environment**: The context in which an agent operates. This can include file systems, network connections, or simulated worlds.
*   **Task**: A specific objective or set of objectives assigned to an agent.

## Constructing a Generic Agent

Constructing a generic agent in AFK typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Define Agent Purpose**: Clearly state what the agent is supposed to achieve. This will guide the selection and development of its skills and tools.
2.  **Identify Required Skills**: Based on the purpose, list the capabilities the agent needs. Will it need to read files, understand natural language, interact with web services, or execute code?
3.  **Select or Develop Tools**: Choose existing tools or develop new ones that the agent's skills will utilize. For instance, a code evaluation agent might use a linting library as a tool.
4.  **Implement Agent Logic**: Write the core logic of the agent that orchestrates its skills to perform tasks. This usually involves a loop where the agent perceives, decides, and acts.
5.  **Configure the Agent**: Set up the agent with its skills, tools, and any necessary configuration parameters (e.g., API keys, file paths).

## Code Evaluation Agent Example

Let's create a Python-based agent that can evaluate code. This agent will be designed to perform simple checks on a given Python code snippet, such as identifying the presence of "TODO" comments or "print" statements.

### 1. Agent Purpose

The purpose of this `CodeEvaluationAgent` is to analyze Python code snippets and report findings based on predefined rules (e.g., find TODOs, print statements).

### 2. Required Skills

*   `CodeAnalysisSkill`: To parse and inspect the code.
*   `ReportingSkill`: To present the findings.

### 3. Tools

*   For this example, we'll keep it simple and use Python's built-in string manipulation and `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) module as part of the `CodeAnalysisSkill` rather than an external tool. For more complex scenarios, tools like `pylint` or `flake8` could be integrated.

### 4. Agent Logic and Implementation (Python Pseudocode)

Here's a conceptual Python example of how such an agent might be structured within a hypothetical AFK.

```python
import ast

class CodeAnalysisSkill:
    """A skill to analyze Python code."""

    def find_todos(self, code_snippet: str) -> list[str]:
        """Finds all TODO comments in the code."""
        todos = []
        for i, line in enumerate(code_snippet.splitlines()):
            if "TODO" in line:
                todos.append(f"Line {i+1}: {line.strip()}")
        return todos

    def find_print_statements(self, code_snippet: str) -> list[str]:
        """Finds all print statements using AST."""
        print_statements = []
        try:
            tree = ast.parse(code_snippet)
            for node in ast.walk(tree):
                if isinstance(node, ast.Call) and isinstance(node.func, ast.Name) and node.func.id == 'print':
                    # In a real scenario, you'd want to get the line number from the AST node
                    # For simplicity, we're not extracting exact line content here via AST
                    print_statements.append(f"Print statement found (details require line number mapping from AST node: {ast.dump(node)})")
        except SyntaxError as e:
            print_statements.append(f"Syntax error in code: {e}")
        return print_statements

class ReportingSkill:
    """A skill to report findings."""

    def format_report(self, findings: dict) -> str:
        report = "Code Evaluation Report:\n"
        if not findings:
            return report + "No specific issues found based on current checks."
        for key, value in findings.items():
            if value:
                report += f"\n--- {key} ---\n"
                for item in value:
                    report += f"- {item}\n"
        return report

class CodeEvaluationAgent:
    """
    A generic agent designed to evaluate code snippets.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.analysis_skill = CodeAnalysisSkill()
        self.reporting_skill = ReportingSkill()
        self.name = "CodeEvaluator_v1"
        print(f"Agent '{self.name}' initialized.")

    def evaluate(self, code_snippet: str) -> str:
        """
        Evaluates the given code snippet using its skills.
        Args:
            code_snippet: A string containing the Python code to evaluate.
        Returns:
            A string containing the evaluation report.
        """
        print(f"Agent '{self.name}' starting evaluation...")
        findings = {}

        # Perform analyses
        findings["TODOs"] = self.analysis_skill.find_todos(code_snippet)
        findings["Print Statements"] = self.analysis_skill.find_print_statements(code_snippet)
        
        # Add more analyses as needed, e.g.:
        # findings["Security Vulnerabilities"] = self.security_analysis_skill.check_vulnerabilities(code_snippet)
        # findings["Performance Bottlenecks"] = self.performance_skill.check_inefficiencies(code_snippet)

        report = self.reporting_skill.format_report(findings)
        print(f"Agent '{self.name}' evaluation complete.")
        return report

# --- Example Usage ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This part is for demonstrating the agent, not part of the agent framework itself.
    
    sample_code = '''
# This is a sample Python script.

def hello_world():
    # TODO: Add more robust error handling
    print("Hello, world!") # A print statement here

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        # TODO: Initialize other properties

    def greet(self):
        # Another print, for testing
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")
        # TODO: Implement actual greeting logic
'''

    eval_agent = CodeEvaluationAgent()
    evaluation_report = eval_agent.evaluate(sample_code)
    print("\n--- Final Report ---")
    print(evaluation_report)

    empty_code = "pass # No issues here"
    evaluation_report_empty = eval_agent.evaluate(empty_code)
    print("\n--- Final Report for Empty Code ---")
    print(evaluation_report_empty)
```

### 5. Configuration and Execution

In a real AFK environment:

*   The `CodeEvaluationAgent` class, along with its skills, would be registered with the framework.
*   Tasks would be dispatched to the agent, perhaps with code passed as a string or a reference to a file.
*   The agent's `evaluate` method would be invoked by the framework when it receives a task.

This example provides a basic structure. A production-ready agent within AFK would likely have more sophisticated error handling, logging, configuration management (e.g., for enabling/disabling specific checks), and integration with other agents or systems.

## Next Steps

*   Explore how to integrate external linters or static analysis tools as `Tools` within AFK.
*   Learn about deploying agents and managing their lifecycle.
*   Investigate how agents can collaborate or be chained together to perform more complex workflows.

This document serves as a starting point for understanding and building agents with the Agent Framework Kit. As you delve deeper, refer to specific AFK API documentation and examples for more advanced features.
