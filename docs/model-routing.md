# Model Routing

## Introduction

Model Routing is a powerful feature that allows for the dynamic and intelligent distribution of user queries to different generative AI (GenAI) models. Instead of being tied to a single model, this system automatically selects the most appropriate model for a given query based on predefined criteria. The primary benefits include cost optimization, enhanced performance by matching query complexity to model capability, and improved resource utilization. By intelligently dispatching queries, organizations can ensure they are using the most cost-effective model that meets the performance requirements for a specific task.

## Core Concepts

### Automatic Query Distribution
At its heart, model routing is about automation. When a user submits a query, the routing system intercepts it and, based on a set of rules or a learned policy, decides which underlying GenAI model (e.g., a fast, low-cost model for simple queries, or a powerful, more expensive model for complex requests) should process it. This eliminates the need for manual model selection by the user or hardcoding model choices in applications.

### Cost vs. Performance Balancing
A key driver for model routing is the ability to balance operational costs with desired performance outcomes. Different GenAI models come with varying price points and performance characteristics (e.g., latency, accuracy, creativity). Model routing enables defining strategies that prioritize:
*   **Cost Optimization**: Routing to cheaper models for less critical or simpler tasks.
*   **Performance Requirements**: Ensuring high-stakes queries or those requiring deep understanding are handled by more capable models.
*   **Hybrid Approaches**: A mix where, for example, a query might first try a cheaper model, and if the result isn't satisfactory, it can be escalated to a more powerful one.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

The model routing system typically sits between the user's application and the suite of available GenAI models. The process can be conceptualized as follows:

1.  **Query Reception**: The router receives an incoming query from the application.
2.  **Metadata Analysis (Optional)**: The router may analyze the query itself (e.g., length, keywords) or associated metadata (e.g., user priority, source application) to gather context.
3.  **Rule/Policy Evaluation**: The router applies a set of predefined rules or a machine learning model to decide which GenAI model is the best fit. These rules can be based on:
    *   Query characteristics (e.g., "If query contains 'translate', use Model-Translate").
    *   Cost budgets (e.g., "If daily spend on Model-X exceeds $Y, route to Model-Z").
    *   Performance targets (e.g., "For interactive chat, use models with <500ms latency").
    *   Load balancing across models.
4.  **Model Invocation**: The router forwards the query to the selected GenAI model.
5.  **Response Delivery**: The chosen model processes the query, and its response is returned to the user application via the router.

## Configuration/Usage Example

Below is a Python-based pseudocode example illustrating how model routing rules might be defined and used. This example assumes a router class that can be configured with rules.

```python
class ModelRouter:
    def __init__(self, rules):
        """
        Initializes the router with a list of routing rules.
        Each rule is a dictionary with 'condition' and 'model_id'.
        'condition' is a lambda function evaluating the query.
        'model_id' is the identifier for the GenAI model to use.
        """
        self.rules = rules
        self.default_model_id = "fallback_model_v1" # A default model if no rules match

    def _select_model(self, query_text, user_priority="normal"):
        """
        Selects a model based on the query and rules.
        """
        for rule in self.rules:
            # Rule conditions can check query text, length, user priority, etc.
            if rule['condition'](query_text, user_priority):
                print(f"Routing based on rule: {rule.get('name', 'Unnamed Rule')}")
                return rule['model_id']
        print("No specific rule matched. Using default model.")
        return self.default_model_id

    def route_query(self, query_text, user_priority="normal"):
        """
        Routes the query to the selected model and returns its (simulated) response.
        """
        selected_model = self._select_model(query_text, user_priority)
        
        print(f"Query \'{query_text}\' routed to: {selected_model}")
        
        # In a real system, this would involve calling the actual GenAI model API
        # For example: response = get_model_response(selected_model, query_text)
        if selected_model == "cheap_model_alpha":
            return f"Response from {selected_model}: Query processed cheaply. Content: {query_text[:30]}..."
        elif selected_model == "premium_model_omega":
            return f"Response from {selected_model}: Query processed with high quality. Content: {query_text.upper()}"
        elif selected_model == "translation_model_fr":
            return f"Response from {selected_model}: Contenu traduit: {query_text}"
        else:
            return f"Response from {self.default_model_id}: Fallback processing for: {query_text}"

# --- Configuration ---
routing_rules = [
    {
        "name": "Simple Queries - Low Cost",
        "condition": lambda query, priority: len(query.split()) < 10 and priority == "low",
        "model_id": "cheap_model_alpha"
    },
    {
        "name": "High Priority or Complex Queries - Premium",
        "condition": lambda query, priority: priority == "high" or len(query.split()) >= 20,
        "model_id": "premium_model_omega"
    },
    {
        "name": "Translation Requests",
        "condition": lambda query, priority: "translate to french" in query.lower(),
        "model_id": "translation_model_fr"
    }
]

# --- Usage ---
router = ModelRouter(rules=routing_rules)

# Example Queries
query1 = "Tell me a short joke."
query2 = "Analyze this extensive dataset and provide a detailed report on market trends."
query3 = "Hello world, please translate to french."
query4 = "This is a medium length query for testing."

print(router.route_query(query1, user_priority="low"))
# Expected: Routes to cheap_model_alpha

print(router.route_query(query2, user_priority="high"))
# Expected: Routes to premium_model_omega

print(router.route_query(query3))
# Expected: Routes to translation_model_fr

print(router.route_query(query4))
# Expected: Routes to fallback_model_v1 (if no other rule matches specifically)

```

### Explanation of the Example:

1.  **`ModelRouter` Class**:
    *   The constructor `__init__` takes a list of `rules`. Each rule defines a `condition` (a lambda function that evaluates to `True` or `False` based on the query and other optional parameters like `user_priority`) and a `model_id` to route to if the condition is met.
    *   A `default_model_id` is specified for cases where no rules match.
2.  **`_select_model` Method**:
    *   This internal method iterates through the `rules`.
    *   The `condition` lambda in each rule is called with the `query_text` and `user_priority`.
    *   If a condition returns `True`, the corresponding `model_id` is returned.
    *   If no rules match, the `default_model_id` is returned.
3.  **`route_query` Method**:
    *   This is the main public method. It first calls `_select_model` to determine which model to use.
    *   It then (in a real scenario) would make an API call to the chosen GenAI model. The example simulates this by returning a string indicating which model was selected and a mock response.
4.  **`routing_rules` Configuration**:
    *   This list defines the routing logic:
        *   Short queries with low priority go to `cheap_model_alpha`.
        *   High priority queries or very long queries go to `premium_model_omega`.
        *   Queries containing "translate to french" are routed to `translation_model_fr`.
5.  **Usage**:
    *   An instance of `ModelRouter` is created with the defined rules.
    *   Several example queries are then processed using `router.route_query()`, demonstrating how different queries are routed to different (simulated) models based on the rules.

## Use Cases/Benefits

*   **Cost Management**: Significantly reduce GenAI operational costs by using less expensive models for simpler or less critical tasks, reserving premium models for where they are truly needed.
*   **Performance Tiering**: Offer different levels of service (e.g., a fast, standard response vs. a slower, highly detailed response) by routing to models with varying capabilities.
*   **Task Specialization**: Route queries to models that are specifically fine-tuned or designed for certain tasks (e.g., translation, code generation, summarization).
*   **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple model instances or even different model providers to prevent overloading and ensure high availability.
*   **A/B Testing Models**: Easily route a fraction of traffic to a new or experimental model to evaluate its performance against existing models before full deployment.
*   **Compliance and Regionality**: Route queries to models hosted in specific geographic regions to comply with data sovereignty regulations.

By implementing a model routing strategy, developers and organizations can build more efficient, scalable, and economically viable applications leveraging the diverse landscape of generative AI models.
