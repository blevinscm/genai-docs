# Use embedding models with Vertex AI RAG Engine 

The [VPC-SC security control](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/security-controls) is
supported by RAG Engine. Data residency, CMEK, and AXT security controls aren't supported.

This page describes the choices of embedding models and shows you how to use
your embedding model to create a RAG corpus. The association between your
embedding model and the RAG corpus remains fixed for the lifetime of your RAG
corpus.

## Introduction to embeddings

Embeddings are numerical representations of inputs. You can use embeddings in
your applications to recognize complex meanings and semantic relationships and
to process and produce language.

Embeddings work by converting text, image, and video into arrays of floating
point numbers called *vectors*. The closer two vectors are in their embedding
space, the greater the similarity of their inputs.

Embedding models are an important component of semantic retrieval systems. The
performance of a retrieval system depends on how well the embedding model
maps relationships in your data.

## Embedding model choices

Vertex AI RAG Engine implements retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), and it offers you the choice of the following embedding models to use
within a RAG corpus:

| Embedding model type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Vertex AI text embedding models | Models trained by the publisher, such as Google. The models are trained on a large dataset of text, and provide a strong baseline for many tasks. |
| Fine-tuned Vertex AI text embedding models | Vertex AI text embedding models are fine tuned to have specialized knowledge or highly-tailored performance. |
| OSS embedding models | Third-party open-source embedding models in English-only and multilingual variants. |

## Supported embedding models

Embedding models are used to create a corpus and used for search and retrieval
during response generation. This section lists the supported embedding models.

| Model version | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `text-embedding-005` | Default embedding model. Recommended for use with a RAG corpus. |
| `text-embedding-004` | |
| `text-multilingual-embedding-002` | Recommended for use with a RAG corpus. |
| `textembedding-gecko@003` | |
| `textembedding-gecko-multilingual@001` | |
| `textembedding-gecko@002` | Fine-tuned versions only. |
| `textembedding-gecko@001` | Fine-tuned versions only. |

### Open source embedding models

The following open embedding models are also supported. You can find them in
[Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/open-models/use-open-models#open-model-garden).

- `e5-base-v2`
- `e5-large-v2`
- `e5-small-v2`
- `multilingual-e5-large`
- `multilingual-e5-small`

## Use Vertex AI text embedding models

The Vertex AI text embedding API uses the [Gecko embedding
models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text-embeddings-api#model_versions), which
produces a *dense embedding vector* with 768 dimensions. *Dense embeddings*
store the meaning of text unlike *sparse vectors*, which tend to directly map
words to numbers. The benefit of using dense vector embeddings in generative AI
is that instead of searching for a direct word or syntax matches, you can better
search for passages that align to the meaning of the query, even if the passages
don't use the same language.

### Gecko models

Gecko models are available in English-only and multilingual versions. Unlike
fine-tuned Gecko models, publisher Gecko models aren't required to be deployed,
which makes them the preferred set of models to use with
Vertex AI RAG Engine.

To identify the default embedding model used or you need a list of Gecko models
that are recommended for use with a RAG corpus, see [Supported embedding
models](#supported-embedding-models).

### When Gecko models are discontinued

The publisher Gecko models might be discontinued. If that happens, the publisher
Gecko models can't be used with Vertex AI RAG Engine, even for a
RAG corpus that was created prior to the discontinuation. When your Gecko model
is discontinued, you must migrate the RAG corpus, which means that you create a
new RAG corpus and re-import the data. An alternative is to use a fine-tuned
Gecko model or a self-deployed OSS embedding model, which is supported after the
model is discontinued.

### Create a RAG corpus with a publisher Gecko model

These code samples demonstrate how to create a RAG corpus with a publisher Gecko
model.

### curl

```python
 ENDPOINT=us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com
 PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

 // Set this to your choice of publisher Gecko model. Note that the full resource name of the publisher model is required.
 // Example: projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/text-embedding-004
 ENDPOINT_NAME=YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME

 // Set a display name for your corpus.
 // For example, "my test corpus"
 CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME=YOUR_CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME

 // CreateRagCorpus
 // Input: ENDPOINT, PROJECT_ID, ENDPOINT_NAME, CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME
 curl -X POST \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 https://${ENDPOINT}/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/us-central1/ragCorpora \
 -d '{
 "display_name" : '\""${CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME}"\"',
 "rag_embedding_model_config" : {
 "vertex_prediction_endpoint": {
 "endpoint": '\""${ENDPOINT_NAME}"\"'
 }
 }
 }'

```

### Vertex AI SDK for Python

```python
 import vertexai
 from vertexai import rag

 # Set Project
 PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
 vertexai.init(project=${PROJECT_ID}, location="us-central1")

 # Configure a Google first-party embedding model
 embedding_model_config = rag.RagEmbeddingModelConfig(
 publisher_model="publishers/google/models/text-embedding-004"
 )

 # Name your corpus
 DISPLAY_NAME = "YOUR_CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME"

 rag_corpus = rag.create_corpus(
 display_name=DISPLAY_NAME, rag_embedding_model_config=embedding_model_config
 )

```

## Use fine-tuned Vertex AI text embedding models

Although the foundation publisher models are trained on a large dataset of text
and provide a strong baseline for many tasks, there might be scenarios where you
might require the models to have a specialized knowledge or highly-tailored
performance. In such cases, model tuning lets you fine tune the model's
representations using your relevant data. An additional benefit of this approach
is that when the model is fine tuned, the resulting image is owned by you and is
unaffected by the Gecko model deprecation. All fine-tuned Gecko embedding models
produce embeddings with 768-dimensional vectors. To learn more about these
models, see [Get text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings).

For more information about tuning embedding models, see
[Tune text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/tune-embeddings).

These code samples demonstrate how to create a RAG corpus with your deployed,
fine-tuned Gecko model.

### curl

```python
 ENDPOINT=us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com
 PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

 // Your Vertex AI endpoint resource with the deployed fine-tuned Gecko model
 // Example: projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/endpoints/${ENDPOINT_ID}
 ENDPOINT_NAME=YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME

 // Set a display name for your corpus.
 // For example, "my test corpus"
 CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME=YOUR_CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME

 // CreateRagCorpus
 // Input: ENDPOINT, PROJECT_ID, ENDPOINT_NAME, CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME
 curl -X POST \

 }
 }
 }'

```

### Vertex AI SDK for Python

```python
 import vertexai
 from vertexai import rag

 # Set Project
 PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
 vertexai.init(project=${PROJECT_ID}, location="us-central1")

 # Your Vertex Endpoint resource with the deployed fine-tuned Gecko model
 ENDPOINT_ID = "YOUR_MODEL_ENDPOINT_ID"
 MODEL_ENDPOINT = "projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/us-central1/endpoints/${ENDPOINT_ID}"

 embedding_model_config = rag.RagEmbeddingModelConfig(
 endpoint=${MODEL_ENDPOINT},
 )

 # Name your corpus
 DISPLAY_NAME = "YOUR_CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME"

 rag_corpus = rag.create_corpus(
 display_name=${DISPLAY_NAME}, rag_embedding_model_config=embedding_model_config
 )

```

## Use OSS embedding models

Vertex AI RAG Engine supports third-party open-source embedding models in
English-only and multilingual variants. This table lists the supported E5 models.

| Model version | Base model | Parameters | embedding dimension | English only |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `e5-base-v2` | `MiniLM` | 109M | 768 | ✔ |
| `e5-large-v2` | `MiniLM` | 335M | 1,024 | ✔ |
| `e5-small-v2` | `MiniLM` | 33M | 384 | ✔ |
| `multilingual-e5-large` | `xlm-roberta-large` | 560M | 1,024 | ✗ |
| `multilingual-e5-small` | `microsoft/Multilingual-MiniLM-L12-H384` | 118M | 384 | ✗ |

In order to use E5 models with Vertex AI RAG Engine, the E5 model
must be deployed from Model Garden. To deploy your E5 model, see [E5
Text Embedding](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/intfloat/model-garden/e5)
in the Google Cloud console.

These code samples demonstrate how to create RAG corpus with your deployed E5
model.

### curl

```python
 ENDPOINT=us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com
 PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

 // Your Vertex Endpoint resource with the deployed E5 model
 // Example: projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/endpoints/${ENDPOINT_ID}
 ENDPOINT_NAME=YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME

 // Set a display name for your corpus.
 // For example, "my test corpus"
 CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME=YOUR_CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME

 // CreateRagCorpus
 // Input: ENDPOINT, PROJECT_ID, ENDPOINT_NAME, CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME
 curl -X POST \
