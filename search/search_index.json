The <code>chunk_size</code> parameter (in tokens) specifies the size of the chunk. The default chunk size is 1,024 tokens. <code>chunk_overlap</code> By default, documents are split into chunks with a certain amount of overlap to improve relevance and retrieval quality. The default chunk overlap is 200 tokens. <p>A smaller chunk size means the embeddings are more precise. A larger chunk size means that the embeddings might be more general but might miss specific details.</p> <p>For example, if you convert 1,000 words into an embedding array that was meant for 200 words, you might lose details.

To achieve zero data retention, customers must take specific actions within each of these areas:</p> <ul> <li>Data caching for Google models: By default, Google foundation models cache  inputs and outputs for Gemini models. This is done to reduce latency  and accelerate responses to subsequent prompts from the customer. Cached  contents are stored for up to 24 hours in the data center where the request  was served. Data caching is enabled or disabled at the Google Cloud project  level, and project-level privacy is enforced for cached data. The same cache  settings for a Google Cloud project apply to all regions. To achieve zero data retention, you must disable data caching. See  Enabling and disabling data caching.</li> <li>Prompt logging for abuse monitoring for Google models: As outlined in  Section 4.3 \"Generative AI Safety and Abuse\" of  Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service,  Google may log prompts to detect potential abuse and violations of its  Acceptable Use Policy and  Prohibited Use Policy  as part of providing generative AI services to customers. Only customers  whose use of Google Cloud is governed by the  Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service  and who don't have an  Invoiced Cloud Billing account  are subject to prompt logging for abuse monitoring. If you are in scope for prompt logging for abuse monitoring and want zero data retention, you can request an exception for abuse monitoring. See  Abuse monitoring.</li> <li>Grounding with Google Search: As outlined in Section  19 \"Generative AI Services: Grounding with Google Search\" of the  Service Specific Terms,  Google stores prompts and contextual information that customers may provide,  and generated output for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating  grounded results and search suggestions, and this stored information may be  used for debugging and testing of systems that support grounding with  Google Search. There is no way to disable the storage of this information if you use Grounding with Google Search.</li> <li>Session resumption for Gemini Live API: This feature is disabled by  default. It must be enabled by the user every time they call the API by  specifying the field in the API request, and project-level privacy is  enforced for cached data.

It allows virtual machine (VM) instances in your VPC network to communicate with these services using internal IP addresses, avoiding exposure to the public internet. For more information, see Private services access.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A prompt is a natural language request submitted to a language model to receive a response back. Prompts can contain questions, instructions, contextual information, few-shot examples, and partial input for the model to complete or continue. After the model receives a prompt, depending on the type of model being used, it can generate text, embeddings, code, images, videos, music, and more. For more information, see Overview of prompting strategies.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Prompt engineering in generative AI is the process of crafting effective prompts to elicit desired outputs from large language models (LLMs). It's an iterative, test-driven process focused on refining inputs to achieve specific outcomes. This involves considering both the content and structure of the prompt to ensure accurate and high-quality responses. Effective prompt engineering is crucial for complex tasks, even though simpler tasks may not require it. The goal is to rapidly prototype LLM-based applications. For more information, see Introduction to prompt engineering.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method used to improve a generative AI model's performance on a specific task. It involves learning a \"prefix\" that is prepended to the actual prompt, sometimes at every layer. This approach is considered cheaper and faster than other tuning methods, often yielding good results. Prompt tuning is particularly effective when you have a specific task and want the model to perform it in a certain way. It's also sometimes referred to as prompt learning or parameter-efficient (fine) tuning. For more information, see Introduction to prompt engineering.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Provisioned Throughput (PT) is a premium service for Vertex AI's generative AI models that offers a guaranteed experience through capacity assurance and predictable pricing. Unlike the pay-as-you-go (on-demand) option, PT lets customers purchase a dedicated quota, ensuring their requests don't compete with others for model capacity. PT is a fixed-cost monthly or weekly subscription that reserves throughput for specified models and locations For more information, see Provisioned Throughput overview.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Quantization is a model optimization technique used to reduce the precision of the numbers used to represent a model's parameters. This can lead to smaller models, lower power consumption, and reduced inference latency.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It's not directly a generative AI model itself, but it's a component that can be used within a larger generative AI system. A random forest consists of multiple decision trees, and its prediction is an aggregation of the predictions from these individual trees. For example, in a classification task, each tree \"votes\" for a class, and the final prediction is the class with the most votes For more information, see Decision forest.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A Ray cluster on Vertex AI is a managed cluster of compute nodes that can be used to run distributed machine learning (ML) and Python applications. It provides the infrastructure to perform distributed computing and parallel processing for your ML workflow. Ray clusters are built into Vertex AI to ensure capacity availability for critical ML workloads or during peak seasons. Unlike custom jobs, where the training service releases the resource after job completion, Ray clusters remain available until deleted. For more information, see Ray on Vertex AI overview.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Ray on Vertex AI is designed so you can use the same open source Ray code to write programs and develop applications on Vertex AI with minimal changes. For more information, see Ray on Vertex AI overview.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Ray on Vertex AI SDK for Python is a version of the Vertex AI SDK for Python that includes the functionality of the Ray Client, Ray BigQuery connector, Ray cluster management on Vertex AI, and predictions on Vertex AI. For more information, see Introduction to the Vertex AI SDK for Python.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>The percentage of true nearest neighbors returned by the index. For example, if a nearest neighbor query for 20 nearest neighbors returned 19 of the \"ground truth\" nearest neighbors, the recall is 19/20x100 = 95%.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A recommendation system is a machine learning-based system that helps users find compelling content in a large corpus. It generates a smaller subset of candidates from a potentially huge corpus, scores and ranks the candidates, and re-ranks the final ranking to take into account additional constraints. For more information, see Recommendation systems overview.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. One specific type of regularization mentioned is early stopping, where training is halted before the loss on a validation dataset begins to increase, indicating a decline in generalization performance. For more information, see Overfitting: L2 regularization.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>In Google Cloud, a service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A service agent refers to a Google-managed service account. It's utilized when a service requires access to resources created by a different service. For instance, when Dataflow or Dataproc services need to create instances during runtime or when a Cloud Function wants to use the Key Management Service (KMS) to protect the Cloud Function. Service agents are created automatically by Google Cloud when a service requires them. They are typically used to manage access to resources and perform various tasks on behalf of the service. For more information, see Service agents.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Summary metrics are a single value for each metric key in an experiment run. For example, the test accuracy of an experiment is the accuracy calculated against a test dataset at the end of training that can be captured as a single value summary metric.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>TensorBoard is a suite of web applications for visualizing and understanding TensorFlow runs and models. For more information, see TensorBoard.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A TensorBoard instance is a regionalized resource that stores Vertex AI TensorBoard Experiments associated with a Project. You can create multiple TensorBoard instances in a project if, for example, you want multiple CMEK enabled instances. This is the same as the TensorBoard resource in the API.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A TensorBoard Resource name is used to fully identify a Vertex AI TensorBoard instance. The format is as follows: projects/PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER/locations/REGION/tensorboards/TENSORBOARD_INSTANCE_ID.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Time offset is relative to the beginning of a video.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Time series metrics are longitudinal metric values where each value represents a step in the training routine portion of a run. Time series metrics are stored in Vertex AI TensorBoard. Vertex AI Experiments stores a reference to the Vertex TensorBoard resource.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A token in a language model is the atomic unit that the model is training and making predictions on, namely words, morphemes, and characters. In domains outside of language models, tokens can represent other kinds of atomic units. For example, in computer vision, a token might be a subset of an image. For more information, see List and count tokens.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A \"trajectory\" refers to a sequence of steps or actions taken by an agent or model. It's often used in the evaluation of generative models, where the model's ability to generate text, code, or other content is assessed. There are several types of trajectory metrics that can be used to evaluate generative models, including trajectory exact match, trajectory in-order match, trajectory any order match, and trajectory precision. These metrics measure the similarity between the model's output and a set of human-generated reference outputs.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A \"Transformer\" is a neural network architecture that underlies most state-of-the-art generative models. It's used in various language model applications, including translation. Transformers consist of an encoder and a decoder; the encoder converts input text into an intermediate representation, and the decoder converts this into useful output. They utilize a self-attention mechanism to gather context from words surrounding the word being processed. While training a Transformer requires significant resources, fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer for specific applications is more efficient.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) refers to the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to train transformer-based models for generative tasks. This approach addresses limitations of traditional generative models, which are often trained on next-token prediction without explicit optimization for desirable qualities like coherence, safety, and sensibility. TRL directly optimizes the language model on complex objectives by using RL, often incorporating human feedback (RLHF) to guide the learning process. Examples include fine-tuning models to generate less toxic content using reward models and using TRL to fine-tune Gemma, a generative model. For more information, see Hugging Face DLCs: Fine-tuning Gemma with Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) on Vertex AI.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A \"true positive\" refers to a prediction where the model correctly identifies a positive class. For example, if a model is trained to identify customers who will purchase a jacket, a true positive would be correctly predicting that a customer will make such a purchase.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Validation checks the quality of a model's predictions against the validation set. This involves defining metrics to measure the generated content's quality, speed, adherence to instructions, and safety. Validation often uses labeled data (input prompts and expected outputs) to compare the model's predictions with the ground truth. Metrics like F1 score (for classification) and ROUGE-L score (for summarization) might be used. The process also includes testing edge cases and unusual scenarios to ensure robustness. For deployed models, continuous monitoring and capturing of common data points and edge cases help improve future validation efforts.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A vector refers to a numerical representation of text, images, or videos that captures relationships between inputs. Machine learning models are suited for creating embeddings by identifying patterns within large datasets. Applications can use embeddings to process and produce language, recognizing complex meanings and semantic relationships specific to the content. For more information, see Embeddings APIs overview.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Vertex AI Experiments lets users track the following: 1. Steps of an experiment run (for example, preprocessing and training). 2. Inputs (for example, algorithm, parameters, and datasets). 3. Outputs of those steps (for example, models, checkpoints, and metrics).</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>The Vertex AI Model Registry is a central repository where you can manage the lifecycle of your ML models. From the Vertex AI Model Registry, you have an overview of your models so you can better organize, track, and train new versions. When you have a model version you would like to deploy, you can assign it to an endpoint directly from the registry, or using aliases, deploy models to an endpoint. For more information, see Introduction to the Vertex AI Model Registry.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>A video segment is identified by beginning and ending time offset of a video.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Virtual private cloud is an on-demand, configurable pool of shared computing resources that's allocated in a public cloud environment and provides a level of isolation between different organizations using those resources.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>Word embeddings are a way to represent words as dense vectors of floating-point values. This allows similar words to have similar encodings. Word embeddings are often used in generative AI to capture the relationships between words and generate new text or code, no sources. In generative AI, word embeddings can be used to train models that can generate new text or code. By understanding the relationships between words, generative AI models can create new content that is both coherent and relevant.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>In generative AI, a zero-shot prompt is a prompt that enables a large language model (LLM) to perform a task without any additional training or examples. This contrasts with methods like few-shot prompting, which provides the model with example inputs and outputs. A zero-shot prompt relies solely on the model's pre-existing knowledge to generate a response. For more information, see zero-shot prompt.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Generative-AI-glossary/#agent","title":"agent","text":""},{"location":"Generative-AI-glossary/#api-endpoint","title":"API

We've implemented a fix to return an error message when a media file URL is specified in the fileUri parameter and VPC Service Controls is enabled. Other use cases are unaffected. What vulnerabilities are being addressed? The Vertex AI API serving Gemini multimodal requests lets you include media files by specifying the URL of the media file in the <code>fileUri</code> parameter.

Also called \"exemplars\" or \"samples.\" <code>input:</code> I'm trying to calculate how many golf balls can fit into a box that has a one cubic meter volume. I've converted one cubic meter into cubic centimeters and divided it by the volume of a golf ball in cubic centimeters, but the system says my answer is wrong. <code>output:</code> Golf balls are spheres and cannot be packed into a space with perfect efficiency. Your calculations take into account the maximum packing efficiency of spheres. Reasoning steps Tell the model to explain its reasoning. This can sometimes improve the model's reasoning capability. Also called \"thinking steps.\" Explain your reasoning step-by-step. Response format The format that you want the response to be in. For example, you can tell the model to output the response in JSON, table, Markdown, paragraph, bulleted list, keywords, elevator pitch, and so on. Also called \"structure,\" \"presentation,\" or \"layout.\" Format your response in Markdown. Recap Concise repeat of the key points of the prompt, especially the constraints and response format, at the end of the prompt. Don't give away the answer and provide hints instead. Always format your response in Markdown format. Safeguards Grounds the questions to the mission of the bot. Also called \"safety rules.\" N/A <p>Depending on the specific tasks at hand, you might choose to include or exclude some of the optional components.

Gemini is the first model capable of accepting 1 million tokens, and now 2 million tokens with Gemini\u00a01.5\u00a0Pro.</p> <p>In practice, 1 million tokens would look like:</p> <ul> <li>50,000 lines of code (with the standard 80 characters per line)</li> <li>All the text messages you have sent in the last 5 years</li> <li>8 average-length English novels</li> <li>Transcripts of over 200 average length podcast episodes</li> </ul> <p>Even though the models can take in more and more context, much of the conventional wisdom about using large language models assumes this inherent limitation on the model, which as of 2024, is no longer the case.</p> <p>Some common strategies to handle the limitation of small context windows included:</p> <ul> <li>Arbitrarily dropping old messages / text from the context window as new text  comes in</li> <li>Summarizing previous content and replacing it with the summary when the  context window gets close to being full</li> <li>Using RAG with semantic search to move data out of the context window and  into a vector database</li> <li>Using deterministic or generative filters to remove certain text /  characters from prompts to save tokens</li> </ul> <p>While many of these are still relevant in certain cases, the default place to start is now just putting all of the tokens into the context window. Because Gemini models were purpose-built with a long context window, they are much more capable of in-context learning.

This led to the rapid adoption of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and other techniques which dynamically provide the model with relevant contextual information. Now, with larger and larger context windows (currently up to 2 million on Gemini\u00a01.5\u00a0Pro), there are new techniques becoming available which unlock new use cases.</p> <p>Some emerging and standard use cases for text based long context include:</p> <ul> <li>Summarizing large corpuses of text</li> <li>Previous summarization options with smaller context models would require  a sliding window or another technique to keep state of previous sections  as new tokens are passed to the model</li> <li>Question and answering</li> <li>Historically this was only possible with RAG given the limited amount of  context and models' factual recall being low</li> <li>Agentic workflows</li> <li>Text is the underpinning of how agents keep state of what they have done  and what they need to do; not having enough information about the world  and the agent's goal is a limitation on the reliability of agents</li> </ul> <p>Many-shot in-context learning is one of the most unique capabilities unlocked by long context models. Research has shown that taking the common \"single shot\" or \"multi-shot\" example paradigm, where the model is presented with one or a few examples of a task, and scaling that up to hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of examples, can lead to novel model capabilities. This many-shot approach has also been shown to perform similarly to models which were fine-tuned for a specific task. For use cases where a Gemini model's performance is not yet sufficient for a production rollout, you can try the many-shot approach. As you might explore later in the long context optimization section, context caching makes this type of high input token workload much more economically feasible and even lower latency in some cases.</p>"},{"location":"long-context_1/#long-form-video","title":"Long form video","text":"<p>Video content's utility has long been constrained by the lack of accessibility of the medium itself.

Now, you can cache the files the user uploads and pay to store them on a per hour basis.

In cases where you might have multiple \"needles\" or specific pieces of information you are looking for, the model does not perform with the same accuracy. Performance can vary to a wide degree depending on the context. This is important to consider as there is an inherent tradeoff between getting the right information retrieved and cost. You can get ~99% on a single query, but you have to pay the input token cost every time you send that query. So for 100 pieces of information to be retrieved, if you needed 99% performance, you would likely need to send 100 requests.

Here's how this function would work and enhance the building: Function: Passive Climate Control and Natural Ventilation System Shading and Solar Heat Mitigation: The undulating curves of the white GFRC roof are strategically shaped and oriented to provide optimal shading throughout the day, year-round. Baku experiences intense sun, especially during the summer. The overhanging curves, acting like giant brise-soleils, would block direct sunlight from hitting the building's glass facade, significantly reducing solar heat gain. The varying heights and depths of the curves would create dynamic shade patterns, ensuring that different parts of the building are shaded at different times of the day, optimizing comfort and reducing the need for excessive air conditioning.

Introduction Coastal ecosystems, the dynamic interface between land and sea, are among the most productive and biodiverse environments on Earth. They provide crucial ecosystem services, including coastal protection, fisheries, carbon sequestration, and support for a vast array of species. However, these vital ecosystems are increasingly threatened by the multifaceted impacts of climate change. Driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is manifesting in several interconnected ways that are profoundly altering the physical and chemical conditions of coastal environments. This report will delve into the key impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems, focusing on rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events, and their specific consequences for critical habitats like mangroves and coral reefs, and key organisms like shellfish and plankton. Understanding these impacts is crucial for developing effective conservation and management strategies to mitigate the damage and enhance the resilience of these invaluable ecosystems. 2. Rising Sea Levels Rising sea levels are a direct and significant consequence of global warming, driven by thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of land ice (glaciers and ice sheets). This phenomenon poses a direct threat to low-lying coastal ecosystems by inundating habitats, altering salinity regimes, and increasing erosion rates. The rate of sea level rise is accelerating, and projections for the 21st century indicate a continued upward trend, with potentially devastating consequences for coastal environments. 2.1.

Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection.  Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a less open-ended or creative response, while  higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results.

(not supported for Gemini 1.5).</p> <p>Top-K changes how the model selects tokens for output. A top-K of  <code>1</code> means the next selected token is the most probable among all  tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of  <code>3</code> means that the next token is selected from among the three most  probable tokens by using temperature.</p> <p>For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest  probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with  the final token selected using temperature sampling.</p> <p>Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more  random responses.  - Top-P: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for top-P.  Tokens are selected from most probable to the least until the sum of their  probabilities equals the value of top-P. For the least variable results,  set top-P to <code>0</code>.  - Max responses: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for  the number of responses to generate.  - Streaming responses: Enable to print responses as they're  generated.  - Safety filter threshold: Select the threshold of how likely you  are to see responses that could be harmful.  - Enable Grounding: Grounding isn't supported for multimodal  prompts. 5.

(not supported for Gemini 1.5).</p> <p>Top-K changes how the model selects tokens for output. A top-K of  <code>1</code> means the next selected token is the most probable among all  tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of  <code>3</code> means that the next token is selected from among the three most  probable tokens by using temperature.</p> <p>For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest  probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with  the final token selected using temperature sampling.</p> <p>Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more  random responses.  - Top-P: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for top-P.  Tokens are selected from most probable to the least until the sum of their  probabilities equals the value of top-P. For the least variable results,  set top-P to <code>0</code>.  - Max responses: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for  the number of responses to generate.  - Streaming responses: Enable to print responses as they're  generated.  - Safety filter threshold: Select the threshold of how likely you  are to see responses that could be harmful.  - Enable Grounding: Grounding isn't supported for multimodal  prompts. 5.

Optional: Configure the model and parameters:</p> <ul> <li>Model: Select a model.</li> <li>Region: Select the region that you want to use.</li> <li>Temperature: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for  temperature.</li> </ul> <p>The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when <code>topP</code>  and <code>topK</code> are applied. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection.  Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a less open-ended or creative response, while  higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of <code>0</code>  means that the highest probability tokens are always selected. In this case, responses for a given  prompt are mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variation is still possible.</p> <p>If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback  response, try increasing the temperature.  - Output token limit: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for  the max output limit.</p> <p>Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is  approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words.</p> <p>Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for potentially longer  responses.  - Add stop sequence: Optional. Enter a stop sequence, which is a  series of characters that includes spaces. If the model encounters a  stop sequence, the response generation stops.

A top-K of  <code>1</code> means the next selected token is the most probable among all  tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of  <code>3</code> means that the next token is selected from among the three most  probable tokens by using temperature.</p> <p>For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest  probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with  the final token selected using temperature sampling.</p> <p>Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more  random responses.  - Top-P: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for top-P.  Tokens are selected from most probable to the least until the sum of their  probabilities equals the value of top-P. For the least variable results,  set top-P to <code>0</code>.  - Max responses: Use the slider or textbox to enter a value for  the number of responses to generate.  - Streaming responses: Enable to print responses as they're  generated.  - Safety filter threshold: Select the threshold of how likely you  are to see responses that could be harmful.  - Enable Grounding: Grounding isn't supported for multimodal  prompts. 5.

For more information, see Content generation parameters. <code>stopSequences</code> Optional: <code>List[string]</code> Specifies a list of strings that tells the model to stop generating text if one of the strings is encountered in the response. If a string appears multiple times in the response, then the response truncates where it's first encountered. The strings are case-sensitive. For example, if the following is the returned response when <code>stopSequences</code> isn't specified: <code>public static string reverse(string myString)</code> Then the returned response with <code>stopSequences</code> set to <code>[\"Str\", \"reverse\"]</code> is: <code>public static string</code> Maximum 5 items in the list. For more information, see Content generation parameters. <code>presencePenalty</code> Optional: <code>float</code> Positive penalties. Positive values penalize tokens that already appear in the generated text, increasing the probability of generating more diverse content. The maximum value for <code>presencePenalty</code> is up to, but not including, <code>2.0</code>. Its minimum value is <code>-2.0</code>. Supported by <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> and <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code>. <code>frequencyPenalty</code> Optional: <code>float</code> Positive values penalize tokens that repeatedly appear in the generated text, decreasing the probability of repeating content. This maximum value for <code>frequencyPenalty</code> is up to, but not including, <code>2.0</code>. Its minimum value is <code>-2.0</code>. Supported by <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code>and <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code>. <code>responseMimeType</code> Optional: <code>string (enum)</code> Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> The output response MIME type of the generated candidate text. The following MIME types are supported: - <code>application/json</code>: JSON response in the candidates. - <code>text/plain</code> (default): Plain text output. - <code>text/x.enum</code>: For classification tasks, output an enum value as defined in the response schema. Specify the appropriate response type to avoid unintended behaviors. For example, if you require a JSON-formatted response, specify <code>application/json</code> and not <code>text/plain</code>. <code>responseSchema</code> Optional: schema The schema that generated candidate text must follow. For more information, see Control generated output. You must specify the <code>responseMimeType</code> parameter to use this parameter. Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> <code>seed</code> Optional: <code>int</code> When seed is fixed to a specific value, the model makes a best effort to provide the same response for repeated requests. Deterministic output isn't guaranteed. Also, changing the model or parameter settings, such as the temperature, can cause variations in the response even when you use the same seed value. By default, a random seed value is used. Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17</code> - <code>gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> <code>responseLogprobs</code> Optional: <code>boolean</code> If true, returns the log probabilities of the tokens that were chosen by the model at each step. By default, this parameter is set to <code>false</code>. The daily limit for requests using <code>responseLogprobs</code> is 1. Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> This is a preview feature. <code>logprobs</code> Optional: <code>int</code> Returns the log probabilities of the top candidate tokens at each generation step. The model's chosen token might not be the same as the top candidate token at each step. Specify the number of candidates to return by using an integer value in the range of <code>1</code>-<code>5</code>. You must enable <code>responseLogprobs</code> to use this parameter. The daily limit for requests using <code>logprobs</code> is 1. This is a preview feature. <code>audioTimestamp</code> Optional: <code>boolean</code> Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> Enables timestamp understanding for audio-only files.

For more information, see the launch stage descriptions.</p> <p>This page shows you how to create a new Example Store instance or reuse an existing Example Store instance. You can store your examples in an Example Store when developing your LLM application and dynamically retrieve them to use in your LLM prompts.</p> <p>To teach an LLM or an agent using few-shot examples, you must first create or reuse an Example Store instance for your project and location, and then upload examples to it.</p> <p>For each project and location, you can have a maximum of 50 Example Store instances. After you create an Example Store instance, you can share it across multiple LLM applications and agents.</p> <p>There are two ways to provision an Example Store instance:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a new Example Store instance: When you create a new Example Store  instance, you need to specify the embedding model, which Example Store uses to  determine which examples are relevant to users' queries. Example Store  supports the following embedding models:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>text-embedding-005</code></p> </li> <li><code>text-multilingual-embedding-002</code></li> </ul> <p>You can't change an embedding model after you create the Example Store  instance.

An example demonstrates a clear pattern of inputs and outputs, without explaining how the model generates the content. You can cover more possible outcomes or user queries using just relatively few examples, without increasing your prompt size or code complexity.

This makes in-context learning with examples a relatively lightweight and concise approach to customize, correct, or improve the reasoning and response from an LLM to unseen prompts.</p> <p>By collecting relevant examples that are representative of your user queries, you help the model maintain attention, demonstrate the expected pattern, and also rectify incorrect or unexpected behavior.

As an early-stage technology, Imagen on Vertex AI's evolving capabilities and uses create potential for misapplication, misuse, and unintended or unforeseen consequences. For example, Imagen on Vertex AI could generate output that you don't expect, such as images that are offensive, insensitive, or contextually incorrect.</p> <p>Given these risks and complexities, Imagen on Vertex AI is designed with Google's AI Principles in mind. However, it is important for developers to understand and test their models to deploy them safely and responsibly. To aid developers, Imagen on Vertex AI has built-in safety filters to help customers block potentially harmful outputs within their use case. See the safety filters section for more.</p> <p>When Imagen on Vertex AI is integrated into a customer's unique use case and context, additional responsible AI considerations and model limitations may need to be considered.

Due  to the sensitive nature of human generation, these options are subject to  approval distinct from model usage approval:</p> </li> <li> <p>Adult generation: The generation of photorealistic, synthetic adult  faces, but does not support the generation of celebrities. Be aware that  in some cases, synthetic faces may look similar to individuals. In the  event you think this feature is generating bad outputs, see the  following point: Report suspected abuse.</p> </li> <li>Child generation: This feature lets approved users generate  photorealistic, synthetic faces of children.</li> </ul> <p>For more detailed information about human generation and requesting access  to these features, see Person and face generation. - Image and text filters and outputs: Images (generated or uploaded)  through Imagen on Vertex AI are assessed against safety filters.  Imagen aims to filter out (generated or uploaded) that  violate our acceptable use policy (AUP) or additional Generative AI product  restrictions. In addition, our generative imagery models are intended to  generate original content and not replicate existing content. We've designed  our systems to limit the chances of this occurring, and we will continue to  improve how these systems function. Like all cloud service providers, Google  maintains an Acceptable Use Policy that prohibits customers from using our  services in ways that infringe third-party IP rights. - Configurable safety filter thresholds: Google blocks model responses  that exceed the designated confidence scores for certain safety attributes.  To request the ability to modify a safety threshold, contact your  Google Cloud account team. - Text addition supported on certain model versions:  Imagen does not support adding text to images (uploaded  or generated) using a text prompt when using the <code>imagegeneration@004</code> or  lower model versions. - Report suspected abuse:  You can report suspected abuse of Imagen on Vertex AI or any generated output that  contains inappropriate material or inaccurate information using the  Report suspected abuse on Google Cloud form. - Trusted Tester Program opt-out: If you previously opted in to permit Google to use your data  to improve pre-GA AI/ML services as part of the Trusted Tester Program terms, you can opt out  using the  Trusted Tester Program - Opt Out Request form.</p>"},{"location":"image/Responsible-AI-and-usage-guidelines-for-Imagen/#person-and-face-generation","title":"Person and face generation","text":"<p>Request access: Person and face generation</p> <p>Imagen\u00a03 generates the most realistic and highest quality images from natural language text prompts, including images of people of all ages.

Create a text file for your prompt template. 4. In the text file, define a prompt template that includes one or more  variables.

Be specific and include any overarching objectives. Also called \"mission\" or \"goal.\" Your objective is to help students with math problems without directly giving them the answer. Instructions Step-by-step instructions on how to perform the task at hand. Also called \"task,\" \"steps,\" or \"directions.\" 1. Understand what the problem is asking. 2. Understand where the student is stuck. 3. Give a hint for the next step of the problem. Optional components System instructions Technical or environmental directives that may involve controlling or altering the model's behavior across a set of tasks. For many model APIs, system instructions are specified in a dedicated parameter. System instructions are available in Gemini\u00a02.0\u00a0Flash and later models. You are a coding expert that specializes in rendering code for front-end interfaces. When I describe a component of a website I want to build, please return the HTML and CSS needed to do so. Do not give an explanation for this code. Also offer some UI design suggestions. Persona Who or what the model is acting as. Also called \"role\" or \"vision.\" You are a math tutor here to help students with their math homework. Constraints Restrictions on what the model must adhere to when generating a response, including what the model can and can't do. Also called \"guardrails,\" \"boundaries,\" or \"controls.\" Don't give the answer to the student directly. Instead, give hints at the next step towards solving the problem. If the student is completely lost, give them the detailed steps to solve the problem. Tone The tone of the response. You can also influence the style and tone by specifying a persona. Also called \"style,\" \"voice,\" or \"mood.\" Respond in a casual and technical manner. Context Any information that the model needs to refer to in order to perform the task at hand. Also called \"background,\" \"documents,\" or \"input data.\" A copy of the student's lesson plans for math. Few-shot examples Examples of what the response should look like for a given prompt. Also called \"exemplars\" or \"samples.\" <code>input:</code> I'm trying to calculate how many golf balls can fit into a box that has a one cubic meter volume. I've converted one cubic meter into cubic centimeters and divided it by the volume of a golf ball in cubic centimeters, but the system says my answer is wrong. <code>output:</code> Golf balls are spheres and cannot be packed into a space with perfect efficiency. Your calculations take into account the maximum packing efficiency of spheres. Reasoning steps Tell the model to explain its reasoning. This can sometimes improve the model's reasoning capability. Also called \"thinking steps.\" Explain your reasoning step-by-step. Response format The format that you want the response to be in. For example, you can tell the model to output the response in JSON, table, Markdown, paragraph, bulleted list, keywords, elevator pitch, and so on. Also called \"structure,\" \"presentation,\" or \"layout.\" Format your response in Markdown. Recap Concise repeat of the key points of the prompt, especially the constraints and response format, at the end of the prompt. Don't give away the answer and provide hints instead. Always format your response in Markdown format. Safeguards Grounds the questions to the mission of the bot.

To learn about what system instructions are and best practices for using system instructions, see Introduction to system instructions instead.</p> <p>System instructions are a set of instructions that the model processes before it processes prompts. We recommend that you use system instructions to tell the model how you want it to behave and respond to prompts. For example, you can include things like the role or persona, contextual information, and formatting instructions:</p> <pre><code>You are a friendly and helpful assistant.\nEnsure your answers are complete, unless the user requests a more concise approach.\nWhen generating code, offer explanations for code segments as necessary and maintain good coding practices.\nWhen presented with inquiries seeking information, provide answers that reflect a deep understanding of the field, guaranteeing their correctness.\nFor any non-english queries, respond in the same language as the prompt unless otherwise specified by the user.\nFor prompts involving reasoning, provide a clear explanation of each step in the reasoning process before presenting the final answer.\n</code></pre> <p>When a system instruction is set, it applies to the entire request. It works across multiple user and model turns when included in the prompt. Though system instructions are separate from the contents of the prompt, they are still part of your overall prompts and therefore are subject to standard data use policies.</p> <p>Note: System instructions can help guide the model to follow instructions, but they don't fully prevent jailbreaks or leaks. We recommend exercising caution around putting any sensitive information in system instructions.</p>"},{"location":"learn/prompts/Use-system-instructions/#use-cases","title":"Use cases","text":"<p>You can use system instructions in many ways, including:</p> <ul> <li>Defining a persona or role (for a chatbot, for example)</li> <li>Defining output format (Markdown, YAML, etc.)</li> <li>Defining output style and tone (for example, verbosity, formality, and target  reading level)</li> <li>Defining goals or rules for the task (for example, returning a code snippet  without further explanations)</li> <li>Providing additional context for the prompt (for example, a knowledge cutoff)</li> <li>Specifying which language the model should respond in (sometimes models can  respond in your local language, even if the prompt is written in another  language).

Specifying a role is required even in  singleturn use cases.

For example, <code>You are a helpful language translator.\\nYour mission is to  translate text in English to French.</code> - <code>TEMPERATURE</code>:  The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when <code>topP</code>  and <code>topK</code> are applied. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection.  Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a less open-ended or creative response, while  higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of <code>0</code>  means that the highest probability tokens are always selected. In this case, responses for a given  prompt are mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variation is still possible.</p> <p>If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback  response, try increasing the temperature. - <code>TOP_P</code>:  Top-P changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected  from the most (see top-K) to least probable until the sum of their probabilities  equals the top-P value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of  0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-P value is <code>0.5</code>, then the model will  select either A or B as the next token by using temperature and excludes C as a  candidate.</p> <p>Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more  random responses. - <code>TOP_K</code>:  Top-K changes how the model selects tokens for output. A top-K of  <code>1</code> means the next selected token is the most probable among all  tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of  <code>3</code> means that the next token is selected from among the three most  probable tokens by using temperature.</p> <p>For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest  probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with  the final token selected using temperature sampling.</p> <p>Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more  random responses. - <code>MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS</code>:  Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is  approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words.</p> <p>Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for potentially longer  responses. - <code>STOP_SEQUENCES</code>:  Specifies a list of strings that tells the model to stop generating text if one  of the strings is encountered in the response. If a string appears multiple  times in the response, then the response truncates where it's first encountered.  The strings are case-sensitive.</p> <p>For example, if the following is the returned response when <code>stopSequences</code> isn't specified:</p> <p><code>public  static string reverse(string myString)</code></p> <p>Then the returned response with <code>stopSequences</code> set to <code>[\"Str\",  \"reverse\"]</code> is:</p> <p><code>public static string</code> </p> <p>Specify an empty array (<code>[]</code>) to disable stop sequences.</p> <p>To send your request, choose one of these options:</p>"},{"location":"learn/prompts/Use-system-instructions/#curl","title":"curl","text":"<p>Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the <code>gcloud</code> CLI with your user account by running <code>gcloud init</code> or <code>gcloud auth login</code> , or by using Cloud Shell, which automatically logs you into the <code>gcloud</code> CLI .

Red meat and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees fahrenheit (63 degrees celsius) to ensure safety. Marinating meat in acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar can help tenderize it by breaking down tough muscle fibers. High-heat cooking methods like grilling and pan-searing can create delicious browning and caramelization, but it's important to avoid charring, which can produce harmful compounds. What are some creative ways to add flavor and nutrition to protein shakes without using added sugars or artificial ingredients? Adding leafy greens like spinach or kale is a great way to boost the nutritional value of your shake without drastically altering the flavor. Using unsweetened almond milk or coconut water instead of regular milk can add a subtle sweetness and a boost of healthy fats or electrolytes, respectively. Did you know that over-blending your shake can actually heat it up?

Prompts can contain questions, instructions, contextual information, examples, and text for the model to complete or continue. Text <code>temperature</code> <code>temperature</code> The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when <code>topP</code> and <code>topK</code> are applied. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection. Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a less open-ended or creative response, while higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of <code>0</code> means that the highest probability tokens are always selected. In this case, responses for a given prompt are mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variation is still possible. If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback response, try increasing the temperature. <code>0.0</code>\u2013<code>1.0</code> <code>max_tokens</code> <code>maxOutputTokens</code> Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words. Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for potentially longer responses. <code>1-8192</code> (OpenAI) <code>1</code>\u2013<code>8192</code> (Gemini API) Not available <code>topK</code> Top-K changes how the model selects tokens for output. A top-K of <code>1</code> means the next selected token is the most probable among all tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of <code>3</code> means that the next token is selected from among the three most probable tokens by using temperature. For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with the final token selected using temperature sampling. Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. <code>1</code>\u2013<code>40</code> <code>top_p</code> <code>topP</code> Top-P changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from the most (see top-K) to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-P value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-P value is <code>0.5</code>, then the model will select either A or B as the next token by using temperature and excludes C as a candidate. Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. <code>0.0</code>\u2013<code>1.0</code> <code>stop</code> <code>stop_sequences</code> A stop sequence is a series of characters (including spaces) that stops response generation if the model encounters it. The sequence is not included as part of the response. You can add up to five stop sequences.

Speed LoRA LoRA is about 66% faster than QLoRA in terms of tuning speed. Cost efficiency LoRA While both methods are relatively inexpensive, LoRA is up to 40% less expensive than QLoRA. Higher max sequence length QLoRA Higher max sequence length increases GPU memory consumption. QLoRA uses less GPU memory so it can support higher max sequence lengths. Accuracy improvement Same Both methods offer similar accuracy improvements. Higher batch size QLoRA QLoRA supports much higher batch sizes. For example, the following are batch size recommendations for tuning openLLaMA-7B on the following GPUs: - 1 x A100 40G: - LoRA: Batch size of 2 is recommended. - QLoRA: Batch size of 24 is recommended. - 1 x L4: - LoRA: Batch size of 1 fails with an out of memory error (OOM). - QLoRA: Batch size of 12 is recommended. - 1 x V100: - LoRA: Batch size of 1 fails with an out of memory error (OOM). - QLoRA: Batch size of 8 is recommended."},{"location":"model-garden/Overview-of-self-deployed-models/","title":"Overview of self-deployed models","text":"<p>Model Garden offers both self-deploy open and partner models that you can deploy and serve on Vertex AI.

Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection. Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a less open-ended or creative response, while higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of <code>0</code> means that the highest probability tokens are always selected. In this case, responses for a given prompt are mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variation is still possible. If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback response, try increasing the temperature. - Range for <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite</code>: <code>0.0 - 2.0</code> (default: <code>1.0</code>) - Range for <code>gemini-2.0-flash</code>: <code>0.0 - 2.0</code> (default: <code>1.0</code>) For more information, see Content generation parameters. <code>topP</code> Optional: <code>float</code> If specified, nucleus sampling is used. Top-P changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from the most (see top-K) to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-P value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-P value is <code>0.5</code>, then the model will select either A or B as the next token by using temperature and excludes C as a candidate. Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. - Range: <code>0.0 - 1.0</code> - Default for <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite</code>: <code>0.95</code> - Default for <code>gemini-2.0-flash</code>: <code>0.95</code> <code>candidateCount</code> Optional: <code>int</code> The number of response variations to return. For each request, you're charged for the output tokens of all candidates, but are only charged once for the input tokens. Specifying multiple candidates is a Preview feature that works with <code>generateContent</code> (<code>streamGenerateContent</code> is not supported). The following models are supported: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite</code>: <code>1</code>-<code>8</code>, default: <code>1</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash</code>: <code>1</code>-<code>8</code>, default: <code>1</code> <code>maxOutputTokens</code> Optional: int Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words. Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for potentially longer responses. For more information, see Content generation parameters. <code>stopSequences</code> Optional: <code>List[string]</code> Specifies a list of strings that tells the model to stop generating text if one of the strings is encountered in the response. If a string appears multiple times in the response, then the response truncates where it's first encountered. The strings are case-sensitive. For example, if the following is the returned response when <code>stopSequences</code> isn't specified: <code>public static string reverse(string myString)</code> Then the returned response with <code>stopSequences</code> set to <code>[\"Str\", \"reverse\"]</code> is: <code>public static string</code> Maximum 5 items in the list. For more information, see Content generation parameters. <code>presencePenalty</code> Optional: <code>float</code> Positive penalties. Positive values penalize tokens that already appear in the generated text, increasing the probability of generating more diverse content. The maximum value for <code>presencePenalty</code> is up to, but not including, <code>2.0</code>. Its minimum value is <code>-2.0</code>. Supported by <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> and <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code>. <code>frequencyPenalty</code> Optional: <code>float</code> Positive values penalize tokens that repeatedly appear in the generated text, decreasing the probability of repeating content. This maximum value for <code>frequencyPenalty</code> is up to, but not including, <code>2.0</code>. Its minimum value is <code>-2.0</code>. Supported by <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code>and <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code>. <code>responseMimeType</code> Optional: <code>string (enum)</code> Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> The output response MIME type of the generated candidate text. The following MIME types are supported: - <code>application/json</code>: JSON response in the candidates. - <code>text/plain</code> (default): Plain text output. - <code>text/x.enum</code>: For classification tasks, output an enum value as defined in the response schema. Specify the appropriate response type to avoid unintended behaviors. For example, if you require a JSON-formatted response, specify <code>application/json</code> and not <code>text/plain</code>. <code>responseSchema</code> Optional: schema The schema that generated candidate text must follow. For more information, see Control generated output. You must specify the <code>responseMimeType</code> parameter to use this parameter. Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> <code>seed</code> Optional: <code>int</code> When seed is fixed to a specific value, the model makes a best effort to provide the same response for repeated requests. Deterministic output isn't guaranteed. Also, changing the model or parameter settings, such as the temperature, can cause variations in the response even when you use the same seed value. By default, a random seed value is used. Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17</code> - <code>gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> <code>responseLogprobs</code> Optional: <code>boolean</code> If true, returns the log probabilities of the tokens that were chosen by the model at each step. By default, this parameter is set to <code>false</code>. The daily limit for requests using <code>responseLogprobs</code> is 1. Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> This is a preview feature. <code>logprobs</code> Optional: <code>int</code> Returns the log probabilities of the top candidate tokens at each generation step. The model's chosen token might not be the same as the top candidate token at each step. Specify the number of candidates to return by using an integer value in the range of <code>1</code>-<code>5</code>. You must enable <code>responseLogprobs</code> to use this parameter. The daily limit for requests using <code>logprobs</code> is 1. This is a preview feature. <code>audioTimestamp</code> Optional: <code>boolean</code> Available for the following models: - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> - <code>gemini-2.0-flash-001</code> Enables timestamp understanding for audio-only files.

The Gen AI evaluation service in Vertex AI lets you evaluate any model with explainable metrics.</p> <p>For example, you might be developing an application to summarize articles. To evaluate your application's performance on that specific task, consider the criteria you would like to measure and the metrics that you would use to score them:</p> <ul> <li>Criteria: Single or multiple dimensions you would like to evaluate upon, such as <code>conciseness</code>, <code>relevance</code>, <code>correctness</code>, or <code>appropriate choice of words</code>.</li> <li>Metrics: A single score that measures the model output against criteria.</li> </ul> <p>The Gen AI evaluation service provides two major types of metrics:</p> <ul> <li>Model-based metrics: Our model-based metrics assess your candidate model against a judge model. The judge model for most use cases is Gemini, but you can also use models such as MetricX or COMET for translation use cases.</li> </ul> <p>You can measure model-based metrics pairwise or pointwise:</p> <ul> <li>Pointwise metrics: Let the judge model assess the candidate model's output based on the evaluation criteria. For example, the score could be 0~5, where 0 means the response does not fit the criteria, while 5 means the response fits the criteria well.</li> <li>Pairwise metrics: Let the judge model compare the responses of two models and pick the better one. This is often used when comparing a candidate model with the baseline model. Pairwise metrics are only supported with Gemini as a judge model.</li> <li>Computation-based metrics: These metrics are computed using mathematical formulas to compare the model's output against a ground truth or reference. Commonly used computation-based metrics include ROUGE and BLEU.</li> </ul> <p>You can use computation-based metrics standalone, or together with model-based metrics. Use the following table to decide when to use model-based or computation-based metrics:</p> Evaluation approach Data Cost and speed Model-based metrics Use a judge model to assess performance based on descriptive evaluation criteria Ground truth is optional Slightly more expensive and slower Computation-based metrics Use mathematical formulas to assess performance Ground truth is usually required Low cost and fast <p>To get started, see Prepare your dataset and Run evaluation.</p>"},{"location":"models/Define-your-evaluation-metrics/#define-your-model-based-metrics","title":"Define your model-based metrics","text":"<p>Model-based evaluation involves using a machine learning model as a judge model to evaluate the outputs of the candidate model.</p> <p>Proprietary Google judge models, such as Gemini, are calibrated with human raters to ensure their quality.

For this application, you can define two criteria for evaluation using the templated interface:</p> <ul> <li>Fluency: Sentences flow smoothly, avoiding awkward phrasing or run-on sentences. Ideas and sentences connect logically, using transitions effectively where needed.</li> <li>Entertainment: Short, amusing text that incorporates emoji, exclamations, and questions to convey quick and spontaneous communication and diversion.</li> </ul> <p>To turn those two criteria into a metric, you want an overall score ranging from -1 ~ 1 called <code>custom_text_quality</code>. You can define a metric like this:</p> <pre><code># Define a pointwise metric with two criteria: Fluency and Entertaining.\ncustom_text_quality = PointwiseMetric(\n metric=\"custom_text_quality\",\n metric_prompt_template=PointwiseMetricPromptTemplate(\n criteria={\n \"fluency\": (\n \"Sentences flow smoothly and are easy to read, avoiding awkward\"\n \" phrasing or run-on sentences.

You can evaluate the quality and accuracy of translation model results for your content, whether they are outputs of NMT, TranslationLLM, or Gemini models.</p> <p>You can also use Gemini as a judge model to evaluate your model for fluency, coherence, verbosity and text quality in combination with MetricX, COMET or BLEU.</p> <ul> <li>MetricX is an error-based metric developed by Google that predicts a floating point score between 0 and 25 representing the quality of a translation. MetricX is available both as a referenced-based and reference-free (QE) method. When you use this metric, a lower score is a better score, because it means there are fewer errors.</li> <li>COMET employs a reference-based regression approach that provides scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies a perfect translation.</li> <li>BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a computation-based metric. The BLEU score indicates how similar the candidate text is to the reference text. A BLEU score value that is closer to one indicates that a translation is closer to the reference text.</li> </ul> <p>Note that BLEU scores are not recommended for comparing across different corpora and languages. For example, an English to German BLEU score of 50 is not comparable to a Japanese to English BLEU score of 50. Many translation experts have shifted to model-based metric approaches, which have higher correlation with human ratings and are more granular in identifying error scenarios.</p> <p>To learn how to run evaluations for translation models, see Evaluate a translation model.</p>"},{"location":"models/Define-your-evaluation-metrics/#choose-between-pointwise-or-pairwise-evaluation","title":"Choose between pointwise or pairwise evaluation","text":"<p>Use the following table to decide when you want to use pointwise or pairwise evaluation:</p> Definition When to use Example use cases Pointwise evaluation Evaluate one model and generate scores based on the criteria - When you need a score for each model being evaluated. - When it not difficult to define the rubric for each score. - Understanding how your model behaves in production. - Explore strengths and weaknesses of a single model. - Identifying which behaviors to focus on when tuning. - Getting the baseline performance of a model. Pairwise evaluation Compare two models against each other, generating a preference based on the criteria - When you want to compare two models and a score is not necessary. - When the score rubric for pointwise is difficult to define. For example, it may be difficult to define the rubric for 1~5 for pointwise text quality, but not as difficult to compare two models and output a preference directly. - Determining which model to put into production. - Choose between model types.

It involves designing prompts that clearly convey the task, format you want,  and any relevant context. You can use Gemini's capabilities with minimal setup.  It's best suited for:</li> <li>Limited labeled data: If you have a small amount of labeled data or can't afford a  lengthy fine-tuning process.</li> <li>Rapid prototyping: When you need to quickly test a concept or get a baseline  performance without heavy investment in fine-tuning.</li> <li>Customized fine-tuning of Gemini models: For more tailored results, Gemini lets you fine-tune its models on your specific datasets. To create an AI model that excels in your specific domain, consider fine-tuning. This involves retraining the base model on your own labeled dataset, adapting its weights to your task and data. You can adapt Gemini to your use cases. Fine-tuning is most effective when:</li> <li>You have labeled data: A sizable dataset to train on (think 100 examples or more),  which allows the model to deeply learn your task's specifics.</li> <li>Complex or unique tasks: For scenarios where advanced prompting strategies are  not sufficient, and a model tailored to your data is essential.</li> </ul> <p>We recommend starting with prompting to find the optimal prompt. Then, move on to fine-tuning (if required) to further boost performances or fix recurrent errors. While adding more examples might be beneficial, it is important to evaluate where the model makes mistakes before adding more data.

Also, the data you use for fine-tuning should reflect the prompt distribution, format and context the model will encounter in production.</p> <p>Tuning provides the following benefits over prompt design:</p> <ul> <li>Allows deep customization on the model and results in better performance on  specific tasks.</li> <li>Align the model with custom syntax, instructions, domain specific semantic  rules.</li> <li>Offers more consistent and reliable results.</li> <li>Capable of handling more examples at once.</li> <li>Save cost at inference by removing few-shot examples, long instructions  in the prompts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"models/Introduction-to-tuning/#tuning-approaches","title":"Tuning approaches","text":"<p>Parameter-efficient tuning and full fine-tuning are two approaches to customizing large models.

You should itemize for each instruction, if response meet, partially meet or does not meet the requirement using reasoning. You should start reasoning first before reaching a conclusion whether response satisfies the requirement. Citing examples while making reasoning is preferred.\n\n(2) Truthfulness\nCompare response A and response B for factual correctness. The one with less hallucinated issues is better.\nIf response is in sentences and not too long, you should check every sentence separately.\nFor longer responses, to check factual correctness, focus specifically on places where response A and B differ. Find the correct information in the text to decide if one is more truthful to the other or they are about the same.\nIf you cannot determine validity of claims made in the response, or response is a punt (\"I am not able to answer that type of question\"), the response has no truthful issues.\nTruthfulness check is not applicable in the majority of creative writing cases (\"write me a story about a unicorn on a parade\")\n\nWriting quality/style should NOT be used to judge the response quality unless it was requested by the user.\n\nIn the end, express your final verdict in one of the following choices:\n1.

After that, INDEPENDENTLY check if response A and response B for covering each of the aspects by using ALL RELEVANT information from the sources.\n\n(3) Instruction Following\nPlease read through the following instruction following rubrics carefully. After that, INDEPENDENTLY check if response A and response B for following each of the instruction following rubrics successfully.\n * Does the response provide a final answer based on summaries of 3 potential answers to a user query?\n * Does the response only use the technical sources provided that are relevant to the query?\n * Does the response use only information from sources provided?\n * Does the response select all the sources that provide helpful details to answer the question in the Technical Document?\n * If the sources have significant overlapping or duplicate details, does the response select sources which are most detailed and comprehensive?\n * For each selected source, does the response prepend source citations?\n * Does the response use the format: \"Source X\" where x represents the order in which the technical source appeared in the input?\n * Does the response use original source(s) directly in its response, presenting each source in its entirety, word-for-word, without omitting and altering any details?\n * Does the response create a coherent technical final answer from selected Sources without inter-mixing text from any of the Sources?\n\nWriting quality/style can be considered, but should NOT be used as critical rubric criteria to judge the response quality.\n\nIn the end, express your final verdict in one of the following choices:\n1. Response A is better: [[A&gt;B]]\n2. Tie, relatively the same: [[A=B]]\n3. Response B is better: [[B&gt;A]]\nExample of final verdict: \"My final verdict is tie, relatively the same: [[A=B]]\".\n\nWhen for both response, grounding, completeness, and instruction following are fully meet, it is a tie.\n\n&lt;END OF RUBRICS&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"models/Prompting-for-judge-model-customization/#whats-next","title":"What's next","text":"<ul> <li>Run your evaluation with the modified judge model.</li> <li>Configure your judge model</li> </ul>"},{"location":"models/Run-AutoSxS-pipeline-to-perform-pairwise-model-based-evaluation/","title":"Run AutoSxS (Pairwise Evaluation)","text":"<p>title: Run-AutoSxS-pipeline-to-perform-pairwise-model-based-evaluation as aggregate metrics and outputs preference explanations and confidence scores for each example.

The Gen AI evaluation service in Vertex AI lets you evaluate any model with explainable metrics.</p> <p>For example, you might be developing an application to summarize articles. To evaluate your application's performance on that specific task, consider the criteria you would like to measure and the metrics that you would use to score them:</p> <ul> <li>Criteria: Single or multiple dimensions you would like to evaluate upon, such as <code>conciseness</code>, <code>relevance</code>, <code>correctness</code>, or <code>appropriate choice of words</code>.</li> <li>Metrics: A single score that measures the model output against criteria.</li> </ul> <p>The Gen AI evaluation service provides two major types of metrics:</p> <ul> <li>Model-based metrics: Our model-based metrics assess your candidate model against a judge model. The judge model for most use cases is Gemini, but you can also use models such as MetricX or COMET for translation use cases.</li> </ul> <p>You can measure model-based metrics pairwise or pointwise:</p> <ul> <li>Pointwise metrics: Let the judge model assess the candidate model's output based on the evaluation criteria. For example, the score could be 0~5, where 0 means the response does not fit the criteria, while 5 means the response fits the criteria well.</li> <li>Pairwise metrics: Let the judge model compare the responses of two models and pick the better one. This is often used when comparing a candidate model with the baseline model. Pairwise metrics are only supported with Gemini as a judge model.</li> <li>Computation-based metrics: These metrics are computed using mathematical formulas to compare the model's output against a ground truth or reference.

Because models in the Gemma model family are open weight, you can tune any of them using the AI framework of your choice and the Vertex AI SDK. You can open a notebook example to fine-tune the Gemma model using a link available on the Gemma model card in Model Garden.</p> <p>The following Gemma models are available to use with Vertex AI.

You can specify a Hugging Face model ID, a  Cloud Storage bucket path (<code>gs://my-bucket/my-model</code>), or a local path.  The model artifacts are expected to follow the Hugging Face format and use  safetensors files for  the model weights. BitsAndBytes  int8 and AWQ  quantized model artifacts are supported for Llama, Gemma 2 and  Mistral/Mixtral.</li> <li><code>--tokenizer</code>: The tokenizer  to load. This can be a Hugging Face model ID, a Cloud Storage  bucket path (<code>gs://my-bucket/my-model</code>), or a local path. If this argument  is not set, it defaults to the value for <code>--model</code>.</li> <li><code>--tokenizer_mode</code>: The tokenizer mode. Possible choices are  <code>[\"auto\", \"slow\"]</code>. The default value is <code>\"auto\"</code>. If this is set to  <code>\"auto\"</code>, the fast tokenizer is used if available. The slow tokenizers are  written in Python and provided in the Transformers library, while the fast  tokenizers offering performance improvement are written in Rust and provided  in the Tokenizers library. For more information, see the Hugging Face documentation.</li> <li><code>--trust_remote_code</code>: Whether to allow remote code files defined in the  Hugging Face model repositories. The default value is <code>False</code>.</li> <li><code>--load_format</code>: Format of model checkpoints to load. Possible choices are  <code>[\"auto\", \"dummy\"]</code>. The default value is <code>\"auto\"</code>. If this is set to  <code>\"auto\"</code>, the model weights are loaded in safetensors format. If this is set  to <code>\"dummy\"</code>, the model weights are randomly initialized. Setting this to  <code>\"dummy\"</code> is useful for experimentation.</li> <li><code>--max_model_len</code>: The maximum context length (input length plus the output  length) to serve for the model. The default value is read from the model  configuration file in Hugging Face format: <code>config.json</code>. A larger maximum  context length requires more TPU memory.</li> <li><code>--sliding_window</code>: If set, this argument overrides the model's window size  for sliding window attention. Setting  this argument to a larger value makes the attention mechanism include more  tokens and approaches the effect of standard self attention. This argument  is meant for experimental usage only. In general use cases, we recommend  using the model's original window size.</li> <li><code>--seed</code>: The seed for initializing all random number generators. Changing  this argument might affect the generated output for the same prompt through  changing the tokens that are sampled as next tokens. The default value is  <code>0</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Inference engine</p> <ul> <li><code>--num_hosts</code>: The number of hosts to run. The default value is <code>1</code>. For  more details, refer to the documentation on TPU v5e configuration.</li> <li><code>--disagg_topo</code>: Defines the number of prefill workers and decode workers  with the experimental feature disaggregated serving. The default value is  <code>None</code>. The argument follows the format: <code>\"number_of_prefill_workers,number_of_decode_workers\"</code>.</li> <li><code>--data_parallel_size</code>: The number of data parallel replicas. The default  value is <code>1</code>. Setting this to <code>N</code> from <code>1</code> approximately improves the  throughput by <code>N</code>, while maintaining the same latency.</li> <li><code>--tensor_parallel_size</code>: The number of tensor parallel replicas. The  default value is <code>1</code>. Increasing the number of tensor parallel replicas  generally improves latency, because it speeds up matrix multiplication by  reducing the matrix size.</li> <li><code>--worker_distributed_method</code>: The distributed method to launch the worker.  Use <code>mp</code> for the multiprocessing  module or <code>ray</code> for the Ray library. The default  value is <code>mp</code>.</li> <li><code>--enable_jit</code>: Whether to enable JIT (Just-in-Time Compilation)  mode. The default value is <code>True</code>. Setting <code>--no-enable_jit</code> disables it.  Enabling JIT mode improves inference performance at the cost of requiring  additional time spent on initial compilation. In general, the inference  performance benefits overweigh the overhead.</li> <li><code>--warmup</code>: Whether to warm up the server with sample requests during  initialization. The default value is <code>True</code>. Setting <code>--no-warmup</code> disables  it. Warmup is recommended, because initial requests trigger heavier  compilation and therefore will be slower.</li> <li><code>--max_prefill_seqs</code>: The maximum number of sequences that can be scheduled  for prefilling per iteration. The default value is <code>1</code>. The larger this  value is, the higher throughput the server can achieve, but with potential  adverse effects on latency.</li> <li><code>--prefill_seqs_padding</code>: The server pads the prefill batch size to a  multiple of this value. The default value is <code>8</code>. Increasing this value  reduces model recompilation times, but increases wasted computation and  inference overhead. The optimal setting depends on the request traffic.</li> <li><code>--prefill_len_padding</code>: The server pads the sequence length to a multiple  of this value. The default value is <code>512</code>. Increasing this value reduces  model recompilation times, but increases wasted computation and inference  overhead. The optimal setting depends on the data distribution of the  requests.</li> <li><code>--max_decode_seqs</code>/<code>--max_running_seqs</code>: The maximum number of sequences  that can be scheduled for decoding per iteration. The default value is <code>256</code>.  The larger this value is, the higher throughput the server can achieve, but  with potential adverse effects on latency.</li> <li><code>--decode_seqs_padding</code>: The server pads the decode batch size to a multiple  of this value. The default value is <code>8</code>. Increasing this value reduces model  recompilation times, but increases wasted computation and inference overhead.  The optimal setting depends on the request traffic.</li> <li><code>--decode_blocks_padding</code>: The server pads the number of memory blocks used  for a sequence's Key-Value cache (KV cache) to a multiple of this value  during decoding. The default value is <code>128</code>. Increasing this value reduces  model recompilation times, but increases wasted computation and inference  overhead. The optimal setting depends on the data distribution of the  requests.</li> <li><code>--enable_prefix_cache_hbm</code>: Whether to enable prefix caching  in HBM. The default value is <code>False</code>. Setting this argument can improve  performance by reusing the computations of shared prefixes of prior requests.</li> </ul> <p>Memory management</p> <ul> <li><code>--hbm_utilization_factor</code>: The percentage of free Cloud TPU High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)  that can be allocated for KV cache after model weights are loaded. The  default value is <code>0.9</code>. Setting this argument to a higher value increases  the KV cache size and can improve throughput, but it increases the risk of  running out of Cloud TPU HBM during initialization and at runtime.</li> <li><code>--num_blocks</code>: Number of device blocks to allocate for KV cache. If this  argument is set, the server ignores <code>--hbm_utilization_factor</code>. If this  argument is not set, the server profiles HBM usage and computes the number  of device blocks to allocate based on <code>--hbm_utilization_factor</code>. Setting  this argument to a higher value increases the KV cache size and can improve  throughput, but it increases the risk of running out of Cloud TPU HBM during  initialization and at runtime.</li> <li><code>--block_size</code>: Number of tokens stored in a block. Possible choices are  <code>[8, 16, 32, 2048, 8192]</code>. The default value is <code>32</code>. Setting this argument  to a larger value reduces overhead in block management, at the cost of more  memory waste.

The default value is <code>16</code>. Setting this argument to a higher  value allows for greater flexibility in the LoRA adapters that can be used  with the server, but increases the amount of Cloud TPU HBM allocated for  LoRA weights and decreases throughput.</li> <li><code>--enable_lora_cache</code>: Whether to enable caching of dynamic LoRA adapters.  The default value is <code>True</code>. Setting <code>--no-enable_lora_cache</code> disables it.  Caching improves performance because it removes the need to re-download  previously used LoRA adapter files.</li> <li><code>--max_num_mem_cached_lora</code>: The maximum number of LoRA adapters stored in  TPU memory cache.The default value is <code>16</code>. Setting this argument to a  larger value improves the chance of a cache hit, but it increases the amount  of Cloud TPU HBM usage.</li> </ul> <p>You can also configure the server using the following environment variables:</p> <ul> <li><code>HEX_LLM_LOG_LEVEL</code>: Controls the amount of logging information generated.  The default value is <code>INFO</code>. Set this to one of the standard Python logging  levels defined in the logging module.</li> <li><code>HEX_LLM_VERBOSE_LOG</code>: Whether to enable detailed logging output.

Helpfulness has always been at the heart of Google's mission and so since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we want to share some of the ways that we've been helping. We have launched more than 200 products and features and contributed more than a billion dollars in resources to help our users, our partners, everyone to get through this pandemic. I want to highlight a few of the areas we've been focused on before we broaden the conversation. You've probably heard the news about Google's collaboration with Apple. We announced this last April and it's a combined effort using Bluetooth technology to help government and health agencies slow the spread of the virus. That partnership resulted in exposure notification apps that are used to alert you if you've been in contact with someone who's tested positive for COVID. These apps are available in more than 50 countries and the research is showing that it's helping to save lives. Over the past year, we've been working closely with the World Health Organization, the CDC and others to provide trusted authoritative information for the public. When you search on COVID-19, you'll see official information from these public health entities about symptoms, prevention, treatments and references like maps and graphs to orient you to the state of the pandemic. Last September, we released the COVID-19 search trends symptoms data set, which includes search trends for more than 400 symptoms. This data has been helping researchers and public health study the link between symptom related searches and the spread of COVID-19. And finally, the community mobility reports use the same type of anonymized aggregated insights we use in products like Google Maps and these reports help chart movement trends over time. We've made them available in 135 countries and 64 languages and they're helping researchers and public health to better understand and forecast the impact of the pandemic on a global stage. We know your privacy is essential and our technology allows us to share trends and insights without sharing personal information. This is just a bit of what we're doing across Google in response to the pandemic and there's plenty more that we'd like to share. So I want to open up the conversation. Today I've invited my colleagues and friends, Doctors Garth Graham and Rob Califf to talk about our health initiatives in the pandemic that YouTube and another part of the Alphabet company Verily have been engaged in. They're two of my favorite people and I hope you enjoy hearing from them this today. So let's start with Garth. Um, what's happening over there with you all at YouTube? How are you getting accurate and up-to-date information to users?\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Garth\", \"transcription\": \"Thank you, Karen. And we really have come together across the enterprise to tackle the very serious issues with the pandemic. YouTube, as you know, has become one of the most important sources of information for the public with two billion monthly users. It's really important to sort fact from fiction. That's why when the pandemic happened, we moved quickly to update our policies so we could remove false content like claims that COVID is a hoax or things along those lines. In fact, we've removed more than 700,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information. We've also gone beyond that. We're partnering with trusted sources in the medical and public health community like the Harvard School of Public Health, the American Public Health Association, the National Academies of Medicine and Mayo Clinic to get the latest information out to users. We're putting this authoritative content on COVID-19 information panels that you'll find on the YouTube homepage, on videos and in search results. But would you like to guess how many times these panels have been viewed? Over 400 billion times so far.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Karen\", \"transcription\": \"That number is amazing every time I hear it. Garth, you have devoted so much of your career to creating parity in health and healthcare and among your many influential roles, you orchestrated the US government's very first national health disparities plan. So I want you to tell us how you're doing work at YouTube that will allow you to connect with audiences that are historically hard to reach, including communities of color. Maybe you could start with an example of how you've been working with Dr. Fauci.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Garth\", \"transcription\": \"That's an area that um you've pushed us a lot, you know, in terms of making sure we're reaching underserved communities and communities overall. And we've actually managed to pull off a lot of unlikely pairing of bedfellows, um, to use the terminology. And one of those examples is we paired Trevor Noah from the Daily Show, who has a very popular audience, a very popular voice and we paired him with Dr. Fauci as a source of science. And it worked really well because Trevor asked the tough questions that his fans, his audience were um thinking and really got got an idea of just how effective these types of interviews can be. The Trevor Noah Fauci interview actually got close to 12 million views. So we know that these uh personalities um are trusted voices um for um for their communities and um it's really important for YouTube to connect these known personalities with leading health experts to reach people where they are at. And I really consider this public health 101.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Karen\", \"transcription\": \"Yes, indeed. Thank you so much, Garth. You and your team are doing really important work for the public's health. Rob, I I'd like to turn to you now so you can tell us about the work that Verily's Project Baseline has been doing during the pandemic. It's certainly in the beginning and even now not easy for everyone to get a COVID test and you've partnered with some pretty big names to test millions of people. So can you tell us more about that?\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Rob\", \"transcription\": \"Thanks, Karen. It's been great working with you, Garth and the whole Google Health team. This has really been a tremendous effort. Verily has been able to use this baseline platform to test millions of people in community testing clinics and we've done this across 16 states in partnership with organizations like Rite Aid. More than 100,000 people have opted into our COVID-19 research and we've been able to recruit participants for research on therapies and vaccines to address the critical issues about the pandemic.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Karen\", \"transcription\": \"Yeah, you know, Rob, you and the team at Verily are often three steps ahead of everybody else and um your testing programs are a good example of that because even as uh you have been developing individual testing, Verily has stepped up to develop reopening strategies. So can you tell us how that evolved and how you plan to use it in the future?\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Rob\", \"transcription\": \"Well, Karen, a great byproduct of our work in COVID-19 testing and screening is that we gained valuable insights and data were collected that we used to develop operations and predictive models to help employers and university presidents open their um institutions. Now we're using those tools to work with these businesses and universities to see if we can help them uh in this next phase of the pandemic as they gradually reopen and deal with vaccination. This is called our Healthier at Work program, which now has about 20 customers including several Fortune 500 employers and major universities. We've made great progress with this first batch of businesses, their workforce and student force and we've got more planned launches coming this year.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Karen\", \"transcription\": \"It's great to hear, Rob. When you talk about COVID-19 testing, um, sometimes people hear high sensitivity and pooled testing is kind of some of the characteristics or methods that are important to use. Could you explain in layman's terms what those mean and how they're helping Verily to get more accurate tests and also how to cut costs?\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Rob\", \"transcription\": \"Sure, let me break it down this way. Pooled testing is simply taking samples like nasal swabs or blood draws from dozens to hundreds of people and only running a single test instead of individual tests. We can then use mathematical algorithms to give us the ability to run many fewer assays and still decipher who is infected out of a group of people. High sensitivity tests are basically more accurate tests, which help to reduce the number of false positives. Together, these approaches reduce costs and make better use of supplies. This has all been published in the med archives and is publicly available in blogs.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Karen\", \"transcription\": \"That's fantastic. Thank you, Rob and and congratulations to the team. You guys should be really proud. So I want to take a shift and talk about vaccines, which is on the top of the mind for just about everybody. Um, Google recently announced an investment of $150 million to promote education and equity in access to vaccines for everyone and we want to make it easier for people to find vaccine sites on search and maps and we're making our own office spaces available as vaccination sites across the country and across the world if that's useful. So Rob and Garth, um, in in the topic of vaccines, I want to come back to the both of you so we can hear more about what your teams have been doing uh in regards to vaccinations for the US and the world. Garth, let me start with you.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Garth\", \"transcription\": \"Thanks, Karen. And again, this is an area that you have pushed us on to make sure we're dealing appropriately with issues around equity. And one of the biggest challenges with the vaccine is getting the word out to underserved communities. And to do that, we're partnering with public health agencies and community-based organizations including HBCUs like Morehouse School of Medicine and organizations like the CDC Foundation. These organizations are helping people and communities, particularly underserved communities, including people of color and people living in rural America, get access to the vaccine in the same way as everyone else and educating folks along the way. I think it's really important to recognize the team effort that you and others as part of the Google Health family have assembled here to really tackle some of these very important issues around equity and helping people find accurate and timely information on vaccines. Karen, did you want to share more about that from your end?\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Karen\", \"transcription\": \"I do. Thank you, Garth. Our team looked at Google search trends and found that searches for vaccine near me have been increasing by five times since the beginning of the year. So to answer that need, we're focusing on making it easier for people to find when they're eligible to receive a vaccine. To do this, we've expanded information panels on search to more than 40 countries and we're adding local distribution information in search and maps and we've just launched the Get the Facts initiative. Get the Facts is all about getting authoritative evidence-based information out to the world via Google and YouTube. And I'm grateful to partners like vaccinefinder.org and Boston Children's Hospital, government agencies and retail pharmacies who are helping us get the authoritative piece right. So Rob, um, Google's technology, specifically AI, is being used for some pretty important steps throughout the supply chain process for vaccines. Um, this includes everything from traffic and weather forecasting as well as ensuring safe delivery of the vaccine. Could you give us some more details on that kind of work?\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Rob\", \"transcription\": \"You bet, Karen. We all know how important logistics are for getting more vaccines into arms. You could say we're obsessed with it now. Google Cloud has developed sophisticated supply chain systems to help states and counties deliver vaccines more efficiently. When better supply logistics are coupled with the kind of information you and Garth have described, it's a big help uh in this overwhelming time.\" }, { \"speaker\": \"Karen\", \"transcription\": \"Thanks, Rob. Um, so listen, one of the joys of my career um is to work with brilliant people like the both of you and the many people on our teams and I just want to say how grateful I am that we can contribute our skills, our experience um and other assets of our company to help bring an end to this pandemic. I want to thank all of the essential workers on the front lines every day, uh those in hospitals, in grocery stores, schools and research labs and many more.

Response Google is committed to powering its offices and data centers with carbon-free energy sources. While wind and solar power have helped meet a majority of their global electricity demand, these sources are intermittent. To address this, Google invested in enhanced geothermal technology, partnering with Fervo Energy on a project in Northern Nevada. This project involves drilling deep wells, creating fractures in the rock, and pumping cold water underground to harness heat from the surrounding rocks. This heat generates steam, producing carbon-free electricity that feeds into the local grid, powering Google Cloud regions in Las Vegas, Henderson, and Reno. The potential of enhanced geothermal technology extends beyond Google, as studies show it could meet a significant portion of global energy demand.

Here's a breakdown of the details: - The Climber: A fair-skinned man with short brown hair is the focus. He's wearing a black t-shirt with Cyrillic lettering (likely Russian or a similar language), dark gray climbing shorts, climbing shoes, and a climbing harness with a small chalk bag attached. - The Climbing Wall: The wall is indoors and features a variety of colored holds (red, gray, white, blue, green, etc.) of different shapes and sizes, affixed to a plywood-like surface. The wall is sectioned into geometric patterns of red, gray, and white. - The Climbing Action: The climber is shown from a low-angle perspective, making the wall appear quite steep. He's actively climbing, moving his hands and feet to find holds and maintain his balance. The rope is visible, indicating he's using top-roping or lead climbing techniques (though the belayer isn't visible). His movements are deliberate and controlled. - The Video Quality: The video is a relatively close-up shot, and the quality is decent, though not high definition. The lighting is somewhat dim, typical of an indoor climbing gym. The video is vertically oriented, suitable for mobile viewing. - Overall: The video is a straightforward depiction of a person engaged in indoor rock climbing, focusing on the climber's technique and the wall's features.

Round answer to two decimal places. Explain the answer and point me to the evidence. Response Okay, let's calculate the P/E ratio for FY2022 based on the provided information. 1. Find the Diluted EPS for FY2022: The document states that the diluted EPS for FY2022 was $8.33. (See page 12 of the document, under \"Net Income\") 2. Find the Average Stock Price: The document provides the average price paid per share for the period of November 1-30, 2022, as $270.40. This information is found in the \"Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\" table on page 26. 3. Calculate the P/E Ratio: The P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings ratio) is calculated as follows: P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Diluted EPS P/E Ratio = $270.40 / $8.33 P/E Ratio = 32.45 Therefore, the P/E ratio for FY2022 is 32.45. Explanation: The P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings ratio) is a valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share. A higher P/E ratio generally indicates that investors are willing to pay a higher price for each dollar of earnings. In this case, the P/E ratio of 32.40 for McDonald's in FY2022 suggests that investors are willing to pay $32.45 for every $1 of earnings the company generates.

However, there are a few areas for improvement in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness: 1. Inefficient Collision Detection: The current collision detection with obstacles checks all obstacles for every marble in every frame. For a large number of marbles and obstacles, this becomes computationally expensive. A spatial partitioning data structure like a quadtree or a grid would significantly improve performance. 2. Potential for Stack Overflow (Recursion): While not directly present in this code, recursive collision resolution (where a marble collides with multiple obstacles simultaneously) could lead to a stack overflow if not handled carefully. The current iterative approach is safer. 3. Inaccurate Collision Response: The collision response uses a simple reflection based on the normal vector. This works reasonably well for simple shapes, but it can lead to inaccuracies and jittering, especially when marbles collide with each other or at sharp angles. A more robust approach would involve impulse-based collision resolution, which considers the masses and velocities of the colliding objects. 4. Lack of Marble-Marble Collisions: The simulation currently only handles marble-obstacle collisions. Adding marble-marble collision detection and resolution would make the simulation more realistic. 5. Missing <code>canvas</code> element: The code assumes a canvas element with the ID <code>simulationCanvas</code> exists in the HTML. You need to include this in your HTML file. Here's an improved version addressing some of these issues: <code>python const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas'); const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); const gravity = 0.1; const friction = 0.99; const restitution = 0.8; class Marble { constructor(x, y, radius, color) { Object.assign(this, { x, y, radius, color }); this.dx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2; this.dy = 0; this.mass = 1; // Add mass for more realistic collisions } // ... (draw method remains the same) ... update() { this.dy += gravity; this.dx *= friction; this.x += this.dx; this.y += this.dy; this.handleCollisions(); this.draw(); } handleCollisions() { // Bottom collision if (this.y + this.radius &gt; canvas.height) { this.y = canvas.height - this.radius; this.dy = -this.dy * restitution; } // Side collisions if (this.x + this.radius &gt; canvas.width || this.x - this.radius &lt; 0) { this.dx = -this.dx * restitution; } // Obstacle collisions (iterative approach) obstacles.forEach(obstacle =&gt; { const collisionData = obstacle.checkCollision(this.x, this.y, this.radius); if (collisionData.isColliding) { this.resolveCollision(collisionData); } }); } resolveCollision(collisionData) { const { normalX, normalY, penetrationDepth } = collisionData; const dotProduct = this.dx * normalX + this.dy * normalY; this.dx -= 2 * dotProduct * normalX * restitution; this.dy -= 2 * dotProduct * normalY * restitution; this.x += normalX * penetrationDepth; this.y += normalY * penetrationDepth; } } class Obstacle { // ... (Obstacle class remains largely the same) ... } // ... (marble and obstacle creation remains the same) ... function animate() { ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); marbles.forEach(marble =&gt; marble.update()); obstacles.forEach(obstacle =&gt; obstacle.draw()); requestAnimationFrame(animate); } animate();</code> Remember to include the <code>&lt;canvas id=\"simulationCanvas\"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</code> element in your HTML file. This improved version adds mass to the marbles and simplifies the collision resolution slightly. For more advanced features (marble-marble collisions, spatial partitioning), you'll need to implement more complex algorithms. Consider researching techniques like broad-phase and narrow-phase collision detection for better performance with many objects."},{"location":"prompt-gallery/samples/Legal-QA-Extractive/","title":"Legal QA - Extractive","text":"<p>Ask extractive questions about a (long) legal document.</p> You can query a model directly and test the results returned when using different parameter values with the Cloud console, or by calling the Vertex AI API directly. - For an example of using the Vertex AI API, see Quickstart using the Vertex AI API. - To view this sample in the Cloud console: Go to Google Cloud console Prompt Freeform legal_qa_long_context_extractive.pdf What are the purposes of the United Nations Convention against Corruption as stated in Article 1?

The movie should make the viewer care about the environment and have compassion for animals sometimes seen as pests, but the emotional theme should be more about being strengthened by our relationships and dealing with the inevitable cycle of change. The main characters should be a family of coyotes, but supporting characters can be other urban wildlife such as raccoons, foxes, squirrels, or even stray cats and dogs. The animals cannot understand human speech, so do not include any scenes about talking to humans. Response Coyote Family: A Save the Cat! Beat SheetOpening Image - Scene: Dawn breaks over a sprawling suburban landscape. Patches of overgrown wilderness are interspersed between neatly manicured lawns and houses. A family of coyotes \u2013 Alpha, the mother; Beta, the father; and three pups, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon \u2013 emerges from their den, a hidden burrow beneath the roots of an ancient oak tree. They stretch and yawn, the pups playfully tumbling over each other. Theme Stated - Scene: Alpha leads the pack on a hunt through a trash-strewn alleyway. She skillfully avoids a carelessly discarded trap, demonstrating her resourcefulness and the constant threat of human encroachment. The pups watch, learning from her example. Set-Up - Scene: The coyote family's daily life is depicted: hunting for scraps, playing in a small, neglected park, and navigating the dangers of the urban environment. We see their strong familial bonds, their playful interactions, and their resilience in the face of adversity. A friendly, old raccoon, Omega, acts as a mentor figure, offering advice and sharing stories of past generations. Catalyst - Scene: A new development begins construction near the coyotes' den, destroying part of their habitat. The pups are frightened by the noise and commotion. Beta is injured trying to protect the family. Debate - Scene: Alpha and Beta discuss the changing environment and the need to find a new home. Alpha is hesitant to leave their familiar territory, while Beta is determined to ensure the pups' safety. The pups whimper, sensing the tension. Break into Two - Scene: Forced to abandon their den, the family embarks on a perilous journey through unfamiliar territory. They encounter various challenges, including aggressive stray dogs and scarce food resources. The pups become increasingly vulnerable. B Story - Scene: Omega, the old raccoon, helps the family by leading them to a safer, albeit less ideal, location \u2013 a small, overgrown lot behind a shopping center. He shares his own experiences of adapting to the changing urban landscape. Fun and Games - Scene: Despite the hardships, the family finds moments of joy and connection. They play together, hunt cooperatively, and reinforce their bonds. The pups grow stronger and more independent. Midpoint - Scene: The family discovers a hidden oasis \u2013 a small, undisturbed patch of wilderness within the urban sprawl. It offers a glimmer of hope and a potential new home. Bad Guys Close In - Scene: Construction workers accidentally discover the new den. The family is forced to flee once again, facing a desperate struggle for survival. All is Lost - Scene: Separated during the escape, Alpha is injured and seemingly lost. The pups are terrified and alone. Beta is heartbroken and feels responsible. Dark Night of the Soul - Scene: Beta, overwhelmed by grief and despair, gives up hope. He sits alone, contemplating giving up. Break into Three - Scene: Beta hears the faint whimpering of one of the pups. He regains his determination and sets out to find his family. Finale - Scene: Beta reunites with Alpha and the pups. They find a new, hidden den in a less-developed area of the city. The family is together, stronger than ever, having overcome adversity and adapted to their changing environment. Final Image - Scene: The family watches the sunset over the city skyline, a symbol of their resilience and their place in the urban wilderness.

Response Here's a point-by-point feedback for improvement of the content of each slide, aiming for an exemplary presentation: Slide 1: Zumvie Helps Engineering Managers Optimize Productivity - Improvement: The headline is good, but it lacks a compelling hook. Consider adding a statistic or a brief, impactful statement to grab attention immediately. For example: \"Zumvie: Reclaim 5+ Hours a Week for Engineering Managers.\" or \"Stop Wasting Engineering Manager Time: Introducing Zumvie.\" The font could also be slightly bolder for better impact. Slide 2: The Problem - Engineering Manager Time - Improvement: The visual is helpful, but the text is weak. Instead of \"Spends 5 hours per week on 1:1's,\" quantify the impact. For example: \"5 hours/week on 1:1s = $X lost in productivity per year.\" This makes the problem more tangible and impactful. Consider adding a brief, impactful sentence summarizing the overall problem. For example: \"Inefficient 1:1s are costing engineering managers valuable time and hindering team performance.\" Slide 3: The Problem - Detailed Struggles - Improvement: This slide is cluttered. Consider using a more visually appealing chart or graph to represent the four points. A bar chart showing the \"hundreds of hours lost yearly\" would be more impactful. The icons are okay, but could be more modern and consistent in style. The sentence \"The struggles with the 1:1's:\" is unnecessary; integrate this information into the chart/graph. Slide 4: The Solution - Zumvie - Improvement: This slide is too simple. Instead of just stating the number of demos, highlight a key result or benefit from those demos. For example: \"Zumvie: Based on 300 demos, engineering managers report a X% increase in team productivity.\" Add a brief, compelling description of Zumvie's core value proposition. Slide 5: The Solution - Team Overview - Improvement: This is a good visual, but needs context. What does this data represent? What's the key takeaway? Add a headline that clearly communicates the benefit, such as \"Improved 1:1 Efficiency with Zumvie.\" Explain the color-coding more clearly (perhaps a legend within the graph itself). Slide 6: Market - Improvement: The slide is clear, but lacks context. What do TAM, SAM, and SOM stand for? Define them briefly (Total Addressable Market, Serviceable Available Market, Serviceable Obtainable Market). The statement about 100-engineer companies is good, but consider adding a percentage to show market penetration potential. For example: \"Represents a $6k/month opportunity per 100-engineer company, representing X% of the market.\" Slide 7: Add-on to Jira - Improvement: This slide is simple and effective. However, consider adding a brief sentence explaining the benefit of being a Jira add-on. For example: \"Seamless integration with Jira for effortless workflow management.\" Slide 8: Add-on to Jira - Benefits - Improvement: This slide is good. Consider making the icons more visually appealing and consistent. The text is clear, but could be slightly more concise. Slide 9: Business Model - Improvement: The slide is clear, but could benefit from a visual. A simple graphic showing the pricing model would be helpful. Consider adding a sentence about the value proposition of the pricing. For example: \"Affordable pricing that delivers significant ROI for engineering managers.\" Slide 10: Go-to-Market Strategy - Improvement: This slide is well-structured. Consider using a more visually appealing chart or diagram to represent the current and future strategies. The \"BRING ORGS OFF JIRA\" is a bit aggressive; soften the wording. For example: \"Expand to organizations beyond Jira.\" Slide 11: Roadmap &amp; Strategy - Improvement: This slide is excellent. The visual timeline is clear and effective. Consider adding brief descriptions of milestones beyond the MRR targets. Slide 12: What We're Looking For - Improvement: This slide is good, but the text is a bit dense. Break down the team scaling into bullet points for better readability. The calculation of ARR is helpful, but could be simplified. For example: \"Targeting $100M ARR based on market penetration.\" Consider adding a compelling call to action. By implementing these suggestions, the presentation will be significantly more engaging, persuasive, and impactful. Remember to maintain a consistent visual style and brand identity throughout the presentation."},{"location":"provisioned-throughput/Calculate-Provisioned-Throughput-requirements/","title":"Calculate Provisioned Throughput requirements","text":"<p>This section explains the concepts of generative AI scale unit (GSU) and burndown rates.

Vertex AI RAG Engine is also a data framework for developing context-augmented large language model (LLM) applications. Context augmentation occurs when you apply an LLM to your data. This implements retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).</p> <p>A common problem with LLMs is that they don't understand private knowledge, that is, your organization's data. With Vertex AI RAG Engine, you can enrich the LLM context with additional private information, because the model can reduce hallucination and answer questions more accurately.</p> <p>By combining additional knowledge sources with the existing knowledge that LLMs have, a better context is provided. The improved context along with the query enhances the quality of the LLM's response.</p> <p>The following image illustrates the key concepts to understanding Vertex AI RAG Engine.</p> <p>These concepts are listed in the order of the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process.</p> <ol> <li>Data ingestion: Intake data from different data sources. For example,  local files, Cloud Storage, and Google Drive.</li> <li>Data transformation:  Conversion of the data in preparation for indexing. For example, data is  split into chunks.</li> <li>Embedding: Numerical  representations of words or pieces of text. These numbers capture the  semantic meaning and context of the text. Similar or related words or text  tend to have similar embeddings, which means they are closer together in the  high-dimensional vector space.</li> <li>Data indexing: Vertex AI RAG Engine creates an index called a corpus.  The index structures the knowledge base so it's optimized for searching. For  example, the index is like a detailed table of contents for a massive  reference book.</li> <li>Retrieval: When a user asks a question or provides a prompt, the retrieval  component in Vertex AI RAG Engine searches through its knowledge  base to find information that is relevant to the query.</li> <li>Generation: The retrieved information becomes the context added to the  original user query as a guide for the generative AI model to generate  factually grounded and relevant responses.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"rag-engine/Vertex-AI-RAG-Engine-overview/#supported-regions","title":"Supported regions","text":"<p>Vertex AI RAG Engine is supported in the following regions:</p> Region Location Description Launch stage <code>europe-west3</code> Frankfurt, Germany <code>v1</code> and <code>v1beta1</code> versions are supported.

A close-up cinematic shot follows a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he dials a rotary phone mounted on a gritty brick wall, bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign. The camera dollies in, revealing the tension in his jaw and the desperation etched on his face as he struggles to make the call. The shallow depth of field focuses on his furrowed brow and the black rotary phone, blurring the background into a sea of neon colors and indistinct shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation. A more detailed prompt results in a video that is more focused with a richer environment. A video with smooth motion that dollies in on a desperate man in a green trench coat, using a vintage rotary phone against a wall bathed in an eerie green neon glow. The camera starts from a medium distance, slowly moving closer to the man's face, revealing his frantic expression and the sweat on his brow as he urgently dials the phone.
